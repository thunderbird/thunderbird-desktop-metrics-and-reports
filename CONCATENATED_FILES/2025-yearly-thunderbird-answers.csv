You must establish an account with a new e-mail service provider and set up that account in Thunderbird. Yes, you will have to change your address because you will be using a new service provider. </p><p>My suggestion: </p> <ol><li> Set up all your Comcast accounts in Thunderbird. </li><li> Right click on each account name in the folder pane, then select ""Subscribe"", and make sure that Thunderbird is subscribing to all your folders in all accounts. </li><li> Retrieve all your messages in all your accounts. </li><li> Create local folders in Thunderbird for storing your Comcast mail. </li><li> Copy (don't move) messages from the Comcast folders to your local folders. </li><li> Back up your Thunderbird profile. </li></ol> <p>Then all your Comcast mail will be saved in two locations, and you can leave Comcast any time you want. </p><p>I believe that you can do all these things in Outlook and not even switch to Thunderbird. I am not certain because I do not use Outlook. </p><p>One thing that could go wrong: If you have zillions of messages in any one folder, the process may fail (according to users' reports). It will certainly take some time. </p><p>Another approach, more appropriate if you have zillions of messages, is to export messages from Comcast and import them into an e-mail client such as Outlook or Thunderbird. If you use this approach, export your messages in mbox format. This information is on the Web: </p><p>1. Set up your new email account: Before you start the transfer process, make sure you have created a new email account with the provider of your choice. Ensure that you have the login credentials ready. </p><p>2. Export your Comcast emails: Log in to your Comcast email account and navigate to the settings or options menu. Look for the “Export” or “Backup” feature. Click on it to start the export process. Choose the option to export your emails in a standard format such as PST or MBOX. </p><p>3. Save the exported file: After the export process is complete, you will be prompted to choose a location to save the exported file. Select a location on your computer or an external storage device where you can easily locate it later. </p><p>4. Import the emails to your new account: Once the export is done, log in to your new email account. Look for the option to import or upload emails. Click on it and select the exported file from your computer or external storage. Follow the instructions provided by the email client or service to complete the import process. </p><p>5. Verify the transfer: After importing the emails, thoroughly check your new account to ensure that all your Comcast emails have been successfully transferred. Pay special attention to any folders or labels previously created in your Comcast account to ensure they have been properly replicated. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

The ""HELSINKI.sbd"" folder content shown in the new image is exactly the same as in ""HELSINKI.mozmsgs"" and it has the same flaw. A folder <strong>XYZ</strong>  in Thunderbird having sub-folders is represented in the profile by an ""<strong>XYZ.sbd</strong>"" file folder and an ""<strong>XYZ</strong>"" mailbox (or mbox) file (<strong>without</strong> extension) and an ""XYZ.msf"" mail summary file. We won't bother about the mail summary file since it doesn't contain messages.  Each sub-folder of XYZ in Thunderbird is is represented in the profile by an mbox file (without extension) carrying the same name as the sub-folder in Thunderbird. Your sub-folders of HELSINKI are themselves parent folders for other sub-folders. That means that file folders like Admin.sbd or TRAVEL.sbd contain mbox files of the sub-sub-folders and even other .sbd folders depending of the depth of the folder hierarchy.... </p><p>Your ""HELSINKI.sbd"" folder doesn't contain any mbox (mailbox) file which is absolutely necessary for displaying the corresponding sub-folder of HELSINKI in the folder pane.  i.e. <strong>Admin.sbd</strong> should be paired with an (even empty) <strong>Admin</strong> mbox file without extension, <strong>TRAVEL.sbd</strong> should be paired with a <strong>TRAVEL</strong> mbox file , ...etc, etc  </p><p>To ""recover"" the sub-folders (make them again visible as sub-folders of HELSINKI) you'll have to create all those missing mbox files manually in a text editor, delete the .txt extension Windows will add and move them in HELSINKI.sbd On TB restart you should find all sub-folders in HELSINKI Don't bother about .mozmsgs folders, they have been created by the Windows search. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

I still have access to my old computer, and had considered downloading Thunderbird to import from Outlook, but decided to use Syscurve as that seemed a quicker way to move my emails. The first thing I'm going to do today is go to Syscurve and convert one email message and see if I can import it into Thunderbird.  If that works I'll try it with a folder, and then move folders one by one. If none of that works, I will go to the Thunderbird Install App I have saved on my personal computer, install it on my old office computer, and see if I can bring over the pst files on Outlook.

So my original question is still open: I can successfully change the Paragraph setting and font message by message, but how can I set the default new message always to appear as I want it? </p>",rogerjarvis1,false,0,0

There are no files with the extension <strong>mbox</strong> in the profile.  When using Thunderbird's standard mail store format ""File per folder (mbox)"" it doesn't mean that all those message files would have an extension .mbox. It's the contrary, all those mbox message files have <strong>no</strong> extension,  they are just <strong>text files</strong> containing the messages of a folder in Thunderbird and having the same name as the folder. An <strong>Inbox</strong> folder with all its messages is represented in the profile by an <strong>Inbox</strong> text file, the Sent folder with its messages will be a Sent file in the profile. If you have a folder ""Travel"" in Thunderbird, there should be a file ""Travel"" in the profile. ""Marketing Analytics"" (without extension) also seems to be a mbox file. These are all called mbox files and mbox also is the term for this type of mail store format. </p><p><em>(b) how to do things via 'one procedure' so that all folders that have this issue of not at all or partially showing sub-folders are fixed simultaneously (and not just 'Helsinki' folder).</em> Since all or most of your mbox files have disappeared you would have recreate all of them with a text editor, one after the other, maybe hundreds of them. I am no Windows user and I don't know how to automate this repetitive Sisyphus task.  </p><p>I still wonder by which mechanism you could have lost all those mbox files when you transferred your profile from your old PC to the new one. You wrote that you did this <em>transfer via copy &amp; paste of the Thunderbird profile folder from the cloud </em>. Maybe the mbox files were already missing in the profile in the cloud? Can you still verify this? </p><p>One explanation for the loss of mbox files with a size of 0 kB could be use of an intrusive cleaning tool or certain function of antivirus software. I have seen this several times in another forum when entire folder hierarchies were destroyed because a cleaning tool had removed all 0 kB files. Yet zero kB mbox files in combination with the .sbd folders of the same name are essential for Thunderbird to ""ciment"" folder hierarchies and display the contents of folders with subfolders. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0

(very few folk do because Thunderbird offers three different approaches to searching mail) If you do not, disable the setting to allow windows search for search your mail.  Is is a very space wasting option that simply complicates backup needlessly.  Everything in those Mozmsg folders, including the folders themselves, exists solely to support that option to allow windows search.  Around a decade ago I disabled the search option and manually deleted the 100,000 odd files that Thunderbird maintained to support the option (it does not clean it's own nest when you disable the option), so Thunderbird now updates three files when I get a new mail, not update three and create one.  Something with a rather high overhead for those with antivirus products monitoring and usually slowing all of those actions. </p><p>Next you are already having errors regarding wdseml files.  Like the mozmsgs folders that contain them, they serve no purpose at all except to support the windows search option.  The are completely unnecessary in the migration of your email from one machine to another. </p><p>I have struggled for a long time trying to explain Thunderbird offline storage,  it is both simple and complex in turns.  The following image using the archive folder on local folders is the closest I have come to making it clear.  At least I think it is clear.

I think you are equating file system folders with Thunderbird folders.   As I tried to explain earlier there is only a slight similarity and mozeml files and mozmsg folders are totally irrelevant.  Thunderbird creates them for the sole purpose of supporting windows search and in the case of the mozeml file they are truncated to 40kb....  anything after that in the text layout of the transmitted email is not there, and that could cut off in the middle of the first image if the message is just a collection of images and no real text. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Outlook uses the easily hacked windows security store which antivirus vendors routinely register themselves as authorized certificate issuers without any form of oversight.  Thunderbird offer no simply hack for certificates. The acceptance in Thunderbird is a manual process and therefore you have to follow some procedure the antivirus vendor has to add their certificate to the store.

In both, it appears in quasi-light light mode with various elements appearing in red rectangles, instead of dark mode as in the email received.  This is a gross rendering failure. </p><p>•  Furthermore, and quite oddly, forwards and replies inconsistently configure message text.  The first failure is that replies are in dark mode and forwards are in light mode.  The second failure is that message text in forwards is white, consistent with the dark mode scheme but not with white background, which is inconsistent with the dark mode scheme.  The third failure is that the client resists configuration of message text to to any other color.

If I click Troubleshoot, the program goes through the same popups and reopens formatted somewhat differently from my usual (with sidebars I normally don't use and bars I normally keep at the top missing) but otherwise as I've described: All the folders (and subfolders and subsubfolders) of all three of my accounts are where I normally see them, on the left, with numbers of unread messages therein indicated by boldface, but if I click on anything it's ""No message found"" and that's that. Only the Address Book remains intact: searchable and with all info.  And a Troubleshooting Information tab is open. If I click on Clear Startup Cache in it, nothing happens--no restart. Maybe that's because it has just restarted? Or does that indicate something else? </p><p>So I'm totally lost. Anything in Troubleshooting Information I should be looking for? </p><p>Looking through the suggestions in the Troubleshoot Mode link you gave, I haven't yet tried Windows in safe mode.

I haven't tried a new profile or a new Thunderbird installation, which I consider last resort because my web email does not have my full archive of messages and my great fear is that I might do something wrong and never again see the emails that apparently are still hiding somewhere in Thunderbird.  </p><p>Many thanks for your involvement. </p>",ImprovementTheyCallIt,false,0,0

The first Launch Profile button brought me to an ad screen that also had a tab for ""Account Setup.""

That resulted in a Thunderbird screen that downloaded 66 emails from the mailfence server.

""Browse through your various profile folders... appdate/roaming....""

I was curious to see what those 2 files would bring in, and the results looked somewhat good, but in a ""Vitamins Taste"" search, that address book result was missing. </p><p>So I tried finding better abook.sqlite and history.sqlite contestants for Address Book import and therefore did a search on my PC for the ""default-esr"" profile that Thunderbird selected by default when I selected ""Import from Another Thunderbird Installation. There were *FOUR*""default-esr"" search results with different filenames, 2 of those having dates just an hour or so apart. I picked one of each. The content that imported didn't seem complete in both those tries... I had searched on a Vitamins address book entry I used to have that didn't show up, and my brother's address book entry wasn't complete. </p><p>So now I'm going to find  and look through non-""default-esr"" profiles now to see how those look and/or import. </p>",alysenet1,false,0,0

Create or Modify userChrome.css Step3. Force Colors in the Message Content Pane Step 4. Restart Thunderbird Software. </p><p>1. Ensure User Customisations are Enabled&nbsp;: </p><p>Go to the Thunderbird menu &gt; Settings &gt; General. Scroll to the very bottom and click the Config Editor button. Click Accept the Risk and Continue. Search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets. Toggle the value to true by clicking the double-arrow icon.

You can find the location by going to the Thunderbird menu &gt; Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information &gt; Open Folder (under ""Application Basics""). Inside your profile folder, look for a folder named chrome. If it doesn't exist, create it (note the exact spelling, lowercase). Inside the chrome folder, create a new text file named userChrome.css (again, note the exact spelling and extension). Open userChrome.css with a text editor (like Notepad). Paste the following CSS code into the file to target the relevant panes: </p><p>css /* Force white background and black text in Folder Pane */ </p> <ol><li>folderPane, #folderTree { </li></ol> <pre> background-color: #FFFFFF&nbsp;!important;  color: #000000&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>} </p><p>/* Force white background and black text in Message List (Thread Pane) */ </p> <ol><li>threadTree, table[is=""tree-view-table""] { </li></ol> <pre> background-color: #FFFFFF&nbsp;!important;  color: #000000&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>} </p><p>/* Force white background and black text in the Message Pane content area */ /* This requires using userContent.css (see Step 3) for the actual email b </p><p><br> </p><p>3. Force Colors in the Message Content Pane </p><p>The message content pane (where you read emails) often requires userContent.css because it displays web content. </p><p>In the same chrome folder, create a new text file named userContent.css. Open userContent.css and add the following:  </p><p>css /* Force white background and black text for email content */ @-moz-document url-prefix(""about:blank""), url-prefix(""chrome://messenger/content/messageWindow.xhtml""), url-prefix(""chrome://messenger/content/messageBody.xhtml"") { </p><pre> body {    background-color: #FFFFFF&nbsp;!important;    color: #000000&nbsp;!important;  } </pre> <p>} </p><p><br> 4. Restart Thunderbird </p><p>After saving both userChrome.css and userContent.css, restart Thunderbird. The folder, message list, and message panes should now have a white background with black text, overriding your dark mode theme selection.  </p><p>This method provides granular control over the UI colors, which is the most reliable way to achieve your desired look in newer Thunderbird versions.  </p><p><br> </p><p>Greetings goiglethunderbird. </p>",Googlethunderbird.,false,0,0

I've read some in this community about global-messages-db.sqlite files, TB's search index. But shouldn't that have to do with existing messages, not with the problem of not being able to write to any folder in the POP account? Thanks to having rebuilt the .msf files, I no longer get the ""unable to open the summary file"" message; my hidden emails are now visible and readable. But incoming emails can't be written to the Inbox. Emails in the process of being composed can't be written to Drafts. I can't delete an email, because nothing can be written to Trash. I can't move an email from one folder to another. Etc. </p><p>2. Each time I reopen TB, I have to permit the program to make changes to the device. Why is this happening? Seems to me it ought to indicate something. </p><p>3. I first had this ""unable to write"" problem for several hours, or maybe a day, then ""unable to open the summary file"" took over and all messages were invisible until I rebuilt the .msf files. Coincidence? Or does ""unable to write"" lead inevitably to problems with the .msf files? Should I be worried that history will repeat itself? What causes a widespread problem that is resolved by rebuilding the .msf files? What typically causes ""unable to write"" in the first place? </p><p>4. The two IMAP accounts in this profile are OK since I rebuilt their .msf files; only the POP account can't be written to. So I don't think there's a general corruption of the profile.

You ask for black headers against white backgrounds, but also want white headers? You are probably more consistent than that and I am just not trying hard enough to follow. </p><p>In any case, in your place, I would simplify. Re-set or remove autoconfig. If you want a mostly dark theme, use the dark theme included with Thunderbird. If you want a mostly light theme, use the light theme included with Thunderbird. If you are not happy with every color in your chosen theme, use only CSS to customize your colors. </p><p>By the way, the instances of ""1"" in our quoted CSS code above should be ""#"".

I am in touch with Cybermesa but they are in the middle of a new email restructure and even their mailbox is full. Usually one gets an actual tech support person with no delay or a quick call-back. When I try to send email I am asked to enter my password and then I receive another pop-up that says it has timed out, which it hasn't. I tried turning off and restarting computer.

Con l'aggiornamento 146.0 ho trovato il nome di entrabe le cartelle modificato in ""Posta inviata"". Fortunatamente nelle nuove cartelle continuo a trovare sia i messaggi ricevuti che quelli inviati e tutto funziona come prima. Ho verificato i filtri ed ho scoperto che le cartelle locali, che prima si chiamavano Posta Piero in corso e Posta Paola in corso, ora sono stati sostituiti entrambi con Posta inviata. E' inoltre assolutamente impossibile cambiare nome a queste nuove cartelle perché anche a me sono scomparse dal menu a tendina delle stesse le voci elimina e rinomina.   Inoltre aprendo le Proprietà delle nuove cartelle trovo il nuovo nome (anche qui non modificabile) ma il percorso indica ancora il vecchio nome della cartella (ad esempio: mailbox://nobody@Local Folders/Posta Piero in corso).

After that I tried to import them back - but it did not work. I found an Zip-file that was related to the Thunderbird data. Tying to import this by using the import function of Thunderbird I got the information that this is not possible because the ZIP-file is to big and I shall unzip the file first. I tried to unzip the file with winrar but I got the information that the files are corrupted. So I have no further idea what to do.  Maybe on Monday I will call someone who is more specialized in data restoring than I am. Maybe he can help me to restore the Zip-file and maybe after that I may create a new profile with this data - if this idea works. So have a nice weekend and best regards from Germany Ralf </p>,skiba0364,false,0,0

You only see emails in other folders because gmail understands it's not an ideal way to see emails. So they created 'labels' as a means of putting a type of tag on an email, so it has a virtual view in any 'label'. Thunderbird has no knowledge of 'labels', it uses folders, so it just downloads to the imap folder eg: Inbox. </p><p>So in Thunderbird, the 'All Mail' folder contains a complete duplicate of everything, incoming, outgoing, archived etc. If you accidentally delete anything from the 'All Mail' folder any copies of the deleted message will be deleted from whatever other folder also has those emails. The 'All Mail' is used by gmail when you choose to 'archive' emails - gmail basically just remove all labels. </p><p>In other words it's dangerous to assume the 'All Mail' is also only the 'Archived' mail. </p><p>Personally, I would not subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder because if it gets corrupted for any reason eg: by an Anti-Virus product trying to 'fix' something, you have a high risk of losing everything. </p><p>This is link to the 'bug reports that are currently being looked at by the developers. </p><p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1998456"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1998456</a> <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2001557"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2001557</a> </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Gmail realises that is not convenient - in fact it's rather useless. So they invented something called 'labels'. Labels is like a type of tag which gets applied to emails, thus allowing a type of virtual view of emails in whatever 'Label' is applied.  Thunderbird has no concept of 'Labels' because it's purely a gmail thing. So imap Inbox, Sent etc is set up as a separate folder and they synchronise with same label names on server and download a copy of whatever is on server. When you choose to 'archive' an email - gmail just removes the label meaning, it does not display inany folder with the exception of 'All Mail'. So ineffect 'All Mail' is where gmail stores archived emails. </p><p>I do not subscribe to see 'All Mail' because it's just a duplicate of everything, all incoming, outgoing etc. If you delete anything from the 'All Mail' folder then you are deleting it off the server and that means that email will not display in any gmail label. It has gone. Imap accounts can only show what is on server in the relevant label for folder. That means if email does not exist in 'All Mail' - it does not exist on server, so will not display in eg: Inbox. </p><p>If any Anti-Virus messed with it, I stand a high risk of data loss. If I accidentally deleted emails from the 'All Mail' folder, I will lose those emails out of other folders leading to data loss. It's much safer to not subscribe to see it in the first place. </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:Just deleted all the files in my archive folder</em> Why&nbsp;? </p><p><em>re&nbsp;:I don't want an Archive Folder.</em> But is it an 'Archive' folder in reality&nbsp;?

All emails you see in Inbox, Sent and all other imap gmail folders will also be in the 'All Mail'. If you delete anything in the 'All Mail' folder, it will be delete off server and will also be deleted from any other folder it appears in. </p><p>I would advise anyone, that it may be safer to not subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder as misuse or folder corruption may lead to dataloss. </p><p>Recently, the developers had a brainwave and though it would be a really neat idea to rename all default server folders to use a set naming convention regardless of what each server actually uses. This has caused some issues and a lot of confusion. eg: the 'All Mail' folder got auto renamed to say 'Archives' In reality the folder is still the 'All Mail' folder but it just displays as 'Archives'. The 'All Mail' folder is not just an archive - it is everything. </p><p>There are bug reports already trying to get this sorted asap.

Whatever you decide, I would advise you get a backup of your profile or at least the 'All Mail' folder. </p><p>Please note: Thunderbird 'All Mail' folder has no knowledge nor stores anything to do with 'labels'. So if you had to upload all your emails back onto the server,you would need to get the 'All Mail' fodler imported into the 'Local Folders' acount first and then move selected emails into specific gmail imap folders in order to get a label reapplied and put email back on server. That's no mean feat when everything is only in 'All Mail'. But at least it's possible. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

It's best to back-up your whole hard drive occasionally. Maybe you are doing this already. For now, you could also just make a copy of your Thunderbird profile. To find your profile folder, click on the Help menu &gt; Troubleshooting information &gt; look for ""Profile Folder"" in the left column of the Application Basic table, and click on ""Show in [...]"" next to it. </p><p>(You could export your messages from Thunderbird, which is easier than copying your profile folder, but, if you have so many messages that you have reached the limit on the server, you may also have too many messages to export.) </p><p>Now, your question. </p><p><strong>If your account is an IMAP account</strong> and your messages are in IMAP folders, whatever you do in Thunderbird or on the server will be reflected in the other location. Deleting messages in one place will delete them everywhere. If it's easier to delete them in Thunderbird than on the server, you can do that and never deal with webmail. </p><p>But before that, you have to preserve your messages in Thunderbird. You do that by creating local folders and copying the messages to the local folders. </p><p><strong>If your account is a POP account</strong>, messages are not sychronized, so deleting them at the server will not delete them from Thunderbird. </p><p>If you do not know your account type, click on the name of the account in the folder pane. Select ""Settings"" from the drop-down menu. Click on ""Server Settings"" on the left, and look at the top right for server type. </p><p>If you need guidance with any step, please ask. </p>",mozilla98,false,1,0

I didn't offer details on what I've done, because I've been dealing with this problem for a few weeks and have not done a calculated / methodical process, rather random attempts, thinking this was a simple and rare glitch. basically I was trying to see if this was a widespread problem, not a rare one. yes All Mail is set to show in IMAP not in labels... it does not work on Gmail web access as you cannot see the size of the email... only Thunderbird allows this and that is one reason I keep using it. yes the right click shows the right physical folder: All Mail. yes I'm subscribed. after all what I've been doing, I was able to FORCE Thunderbird to re-download all emails from to this folder, and currently is in the email Nr 106581... about two emails per second.  disabled the sleep of the HD during the night and was able to have some extra 30,000...  I'm close to see all the emails been re-downloaded soon... I'll see then, if I can avoid what I'd consider my last attempt, that will be to delete the folder at the physical location in my HD, and re-start the downloading. again, I thought this was probably something more common and just waiting for an update or a simple trick to solve it. never thought to engage into this kind of details and length of exchange. thanks this email account is a shortest/trimmed version of several Gmail accounts, and this account only have 30 years of emails... I used to move all my older emails, using drag and drop in TB to other storage only emails I had.  it took me some time to optimize my way of keeping the content and getting rid of the attachments (only TB can do it).  again thanks... </p>",JorgeVismara,false,0,0

Is that what you were asking about? And almost everyone here is a user, not in a position to sell services. </p><p>But your messages are in Thunderbird, right? </p><p>Is your account an IMAP account or a POP account? If you do not know, go to account settings &gt; click on ""server settings"" and note the server type at top right. I will assume that it is an IMAP account. </p><p>There are several ways to make a back-up copy of your messages in Thunderbird. The best way for you probably depends on how many folders you have, how many messages there are in your folders, and what you want to do with the messages. In your situation, most people want their messages to remain available in Thunderbird. If you do not have many thousands of messages, you could copy the messages to local folders. If you have many thousands of messages, that copy process may be less reliable, so another approach might be better. </p><p>In your place, I would get the excellent add-on ImportExportToolsNG and use it to export my account onto an external drive. That would be a good back-up copy. Then, if I wanted access to those exported messages, I would import them into local folders in Thunderbird. </p><p>People here can guide you through that process. </p><p>Before doing making that back-up copy, do two things: </p> <ol><li> To ensure that all your messages are in Thunderbird, set properties of each folder to ""When getting new messages for this account, always check this folder"" and ""select this folder for offline use"". </li><li> Make a back-up copy of your whole profile. If your profile is less than two GB in size, use Tools - Export (to an external drive). If it is larger than two GB in size, copy in the file system instead of exporting from Thunderbird. Again, people here can guide you. </li></ol> <p>By the way, I'm not certain that you have to do anything before the account expires other than ensure that all your messages are downloaded into Thunderbird. You would continue to have access to all your messages in Thunderbird. But you may have some minor issues replying to messages if they are still attached to an expired account. I don't know. I would make a good back-up copy before the account expires. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

I have no true solution, but I suggest rightclicking on each folder and checking properties to verify that thunderbird thinks they're both assigned to the account. Also, check to see which one thunderbird is using for sent messages. Once you can verify the unneeded one, you may be able to rightclick and delete. But this may also be a case where this bug may be fixed in an upcoming release - but I don't know that. My guess is that your account may have a folder that the 146 update thought might be used for sent messages and decided to name it such. But the logic used escapes me.

I've tried everything I can think of to get Gmail to sync those emails with TB, but nothing happens.  </p><p>Any hints as to how to get the emails to migrate from Gmail to TB? </p><p>And to answer your question about old profiles...I couldn't find anything on my laptop in the old profile folder from August of this year except a 2KB .json file.  </p><p>But  I <strong>JUST NOW</strong> realized that since my laptop is new, iDrive might have the backups from my old laptop...and there they were!! In fact, there are 3 Profiles folders!!!!!  One folder has very little, the 2nd one has nothing but a .json file...but the 3rd one has EVERYTHING. All my old folders, subfolders, etc. Now, the ""Date Modified"" is from 2022 and 2023...but I just got this new laptop in October of this year, so depending upon whether or not there are more recent email in those folders, I may have only lost 2 months worth of emails, </p><p>But now my question is, what do I do with the profile and all the folders? Do I just restore them all to my new laptop (and perhaps create a mess of conflicting folders &amp; emails that will take me days to reorganize)? But if that's the worst that could happen, I'll live with it and do what I have to do. </p><p>Again, I can't thank you enough...your question about the backup profile was what got me thinking about the previous iDrive backup!  I'll wait to hear from you with your suggestions before I do ANYTHING. </p><p>Joan </p>",joanm48,false,0,0

However, the server is bound to accept mail sent to you and Thunderbird has no control over the server, it just displays emails and can sort incoming mail automatically into specific folders. </p><p>The server will accept any emails sent to your email address. You may be able to set up a rule on the server (via webmail account) to choose whether a sender is a safe sender or not. Usually, the server will put those emails from the unsafe sender directly into the server 'Spam' folder. </p><p>In any email client: Pop mail accounts can only access the server Inbox and download whatever has not previously been downloaded to the Pop account Inbox. </p><p>If you do not want to see whatever the server puts in the server/webmail Spam folder then a Pop account will not display anything in server Spam folder as it cannot access it. Most servers tend to auto empty the server Spam folder periodically. But do check out that this does occur otherwise you would need to periodically loggon to webmail account and manaully empty it yourself. </p><p>In a way this is a workaround so you do not see emails in Thunderbird Pop account if server has already put them in server Spam folder. </p><p>Imap accounts subscribe to see server folders and can only display whatever is those server folders. As folders synchronise with server, they act as if one and the same. You basically are seeing a mirror image of your webmail account.  </p><p>In Thunderbird you have some options: You can set up the Account Settings &gt; Junk/Spam Settings for each account and train the Adaptive Junk/Spam controls to auto recognise what is and what is not spam. It would be important to set up your address books as whitelists and make sure the unwanted email address is not in any of those address books. </p><p>Another alternative In Thunderbird, you can create a Message Filter. </p> <ul><li> Tools &gt; Message Filters </li><li> Click on 'New' </li><li> Give filter a suitable name like 'Block senders' </li><li> Select 'Getting new mail' and 'Filter before Junk Classification' </li><li> Select 'Match ANY of the following' - that means you can set up more than one email address which you want to auto delete or send to spam. </li><li> 'From' and 'contains' and enter email address </li><li> to add another click on + icon and repeat except enter a different email address. </li></ul> <p>Perform these actions: Suggest you use any of these options </p> <ul><li> 'Set junk Status to ' and 'Junk' </li><li> 'Move message to' and 'Spam on account name' </li></ul> <p>OR </p> <ul><li> 'Delete Message' </li></ul> <p>OR </p> <ul><li> 'Move message to' and select 'Deleted on account name' </li><li> Click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p>Put filter at top of list as the filter operate from the top downwards.

How can I correct this because, because as it stands, it just doesn't make sense; how can you have your <strong>Sent</strong> messages in your <strong>INBOX</strong>? ?</blockquote> <p>Yet you say you have spoken with the server admin.  Were they so inexperienced with email that they were unaware that they have configured their mail server to place all folders as sub folders of the inbox.  Usually by specifying the inbox as the server directory for mail.   Open the account settings in Thunderbird then the advanced setting in the server settings pane.  Enter the correct IMAP server directory for the mail server.  It will be some variation of inbox,  but as case is relevant it would really be easier of the mail admin just told you what it was.  But from the images you posted I would guess is is INBOX (all upper case) like as if it was setup and managed by someone that was only familiar with Windows. </p><p><br> Google AI suggest this much more nicely written explanation </p> <blockquote> ""server directory set to INBOX"" is generally a configuration setting for an IMAP email client that tells the client where the main mailbox folders are located on the server. This is a common solution when all your other email folders (like ""Sent"", ""Drafts"", etc.) appear as subfolders nested inside your Inbox, rather than at the top level of your folder list.  How to Apply This Setting in Popular Email Clients The specific steps to apply this setting depend on your email client:      Mozilla Thunderbird / Postbox:         Go to Account Settings (under the Tools or Edit menu, depending on your OS).         Select Server Settings for the specific email account.         Click the Advanced button.         In the field labeled IMAP server directory (or IMAP Path Prefix), type INBOX.

After some searching, I found both Paint and Photos and set Paint as the app to use and also selected Always Use this app. </p><p>When checking back in the Thunderbird Content Type table, I found that Content Type JPG File has been changed from Always Ask to Use mspaint.exe as shown in the attached image.  I'm not sure why the JPG File content was chosen but HEIC files now always open with Paint when clicked.  Is this a bug?  Should not the JPG File content type remain Always Ask and a ""new"" content type of HEIC be ""added"" with Action of Use mspaint.exe?  I'm confused as to why this works as it does.  Any recommendations?  Thank you. </p><p>I am using TB 145.0 (64 bit) and Win11. </p><p>So far, I can open the HEIC file with Paint as desired but I suppose all JPG files will now open with Paint which is not what I desire for the longer term. </p>",TbirdUser53,false,0,0

Here are the primary methods to fix this problem: 1. Check Folder Subscriptions (IMAP Accounts)  The most common reason for missing folders, or ""phantom"" folders (greyed out and italicized), is incorrect folder subscriptions.  Right-click on the email account name in the folder pane. Select Subscribe... from the context menu. A window will pop up showing all available folders on the server. Click Refresh to ensure the list is current. Check the boxes for all the folders that should be displayed in Thunderbird. Uncheck any ""phantom"" folders in incorrect locations. Click OK.  2. Verify Account Settings (IMAP)  Incorrect IMAP server settings can also lead to hierarchy issues.  Go to Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; [Your Account Name] &gt; Server Settings. Click the Advanced... button. Ensure the option Server supports folders containing subfolders and messages is checked. <strong>Check the ""IMAP server directory"" or ""Namespace"" setting if your provider requires a specific folder prefix (e.g., ""INBOX""). </strong> <strong> </strong> ... and so on""<em> </em> </p><p>But the bit in bold is what caused me to go wrong / confused me as I was looking at <strong>Personal namespace</strong> and changing that rather than the IMAP server directory as all outlook and gmail (which I used for comparison) folders for IMAP server setting are blank, hence I <em>thought</em> it should be blank. If I'd just tried that once, I would have found that to be the cause.

Points are actually an anathema on a screen as they are a little like dividing the number of friends you have by your age when it comes to a selection method.  How high is that 10 point text  really.  Given it's origin in putting print on paper it should come as no real surprise that is is defined has been defined loosly as since the 18th century, being between 0.18 and 0.4 millimeters.  A de-facto standard exists in the graphical user interface world that a point is  1⁄72 of an inch (or exactly 0.3527 mm) so screen fonts tend to be fairly close to that.  But not exactly as some screens are simply not capable of splitting a pixel in half to make 1⁄72 of an inch.  SO if you compose on an apple computer with a pixel doubling retina display and the person who reads your mail is using an older android phone is is highly likely that that professionally laid out email you composed will offer the reader a very sub standard experience in trying to navigate inside it.  Text may be wider that the screen and require constant left and right scrolling.  The font displayed might be just about anything.  Just because you have to one you selected installed does not mean your reader will. </p><p>Personally I find none of that modern or powerful.  It is however a perfect recipe for failure in the hands of those that are unaware different screens make fonts measured in points different sizes and ultimately HTML may not even use the font you selected,  but something from the same ""<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/font-family"" rel=""nofollow"">font family</a>"" as I suggested before, It might be you are sending what you think is an email formatted with ""Gill Sans Extrabold"" as the font.  What your reader may get is any font on their system that is also a sans-serif font. </p><p>I have not routinely written any email in plain text for decades using Thunderbird although I have the product configured to send a text and HTML version,  just in case I encounter some of the Luddites that insist on plain text.  The are still some and some of them are involved in the Thunderbird project.  I am however very conservative in my use of fonts both by name and by size as be default HTML does not use points to define font sizes.  See <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_size.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_size.asp</a>  there you will see that fonts in HTML as defined largely using words or in more extreme cases as pixels </p> <blockquote>     px: Pixels offers fixed and precise control over the font size.     xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large. These keywords has a predefined set of sizes in browsers. </blockquote> <p><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-12-20-15-25-06-72cecd.png""> </p><p>As you have no real idea just how big a pixel is on your readers display you take a gamble specifying that in size (although Thunderbird does allow it) what is far more reliable as the basic sizes normal medium etc,  hence Thunderbird's font selector offers to make fonts bigger and small not specifying a particular point size as size as 1⁄72 of an inch has little meaning on a 4"" display.  What does have meaning is that the local reader will use a built in zoom approach to make normal sized text readable and heading sizes a larger size again based on it's internal metrics as to what is readable.  It will make not attempt to even look at your 11 point font and will strictly render your 13 pixel font over 13 pixels regardless of the real world size  so expect complaints from folk about being send micro dots or worse still clownishly large text.  I see complaints here in this forum over the years from folk that think writing an email is the same as writing a letter on a typewriter,.  The sort answer is it is not very similar at all  ASo to your original question. </p> <blockquote> When will Thunderbird provide powerful and state of the art formating stuff? </blockquote> <p>Possibly never, as an open source project there will undoubtedly be improvements to the editor component but they will be temptered by the community and the imperative that email is a communication medium.  change will probably be slow and come in starts.  The editor is dated and long over due for an overhaul, but will you ever get you word processor?  Probably not, as it will forever be tied to offering a good experience in both composition and reading of email.  You can not offer the level of control to the sender you ask for (exact sizing to the pixel and specifying font names to be used) and try and guarantee a similar level of reading experience.  Microsoft do it with their emails, at the expense of composing huge and complicated emails that often only work correctly in Microsoft mail clients because they have ""innovated""  and at times requiring the download of a font larger than the email to read it with.  That is something folk paying for expensive bandwidth in some countries object to (that can sometimes be the ones insisting on plain text as is get the message across without the expensive overheads of ""flair"") </p> <blockquote> 2) Is there an addon which adds powerful and state of the art formating stuff? </blockquote> <p>Have you looked?

They are going out of fashion and really their intersections with 64bit operating systems are perhaps becoming somewhat problematical. </p><p>Second all this discussion about multiple versions of files and no one has addresses the elephant in the room.  Why is there more than one file.  Have you tried your operating system in safe made (you need a wired internet connection and they are becoming rare in some countries) </p><p>Almost all issues where writing to disk is an issue come from a very few causes and none to my knowledge are Thunderbird. </p><p>1. A corrupt hard disk.  Have you checked the physical integrity of the data on the disk? You appear to be using Windows so the tool you would need to use would be <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/chkdsk?tabs=hdd%2Cevent-viewer"" rel=""nofollow"">chkdsk</a>.  It is a standard part of windows. I suggest this because you are asked on each start of Thunderbird to allow changes.  This would be Thunderbird checking the default mail news and calendar client for Windows and setting itself to perform those functions.  There are only two possible reasons for that to be on repeat.  The settings is being changed between starts or the disk is corrupt and the changes are not saved.  The easiest top check is the disk integrity. </p><p>When it comes to things reverting or modifying system defaults what other application is prompting you for the same thing.  Perhaps outlook?  that could also be setting up this repeated asking for the same changes. </p><p>2. An overactive antivirus/security suite.  Unfortunately this is a major growth industry with antivirus products becoming more aggressive in their settings and scanning to the point that they often prevent Thunderbird from saving changes or getting mail.  They are a primary cause of file contention which bubbles up to the surface as inability to write to disk or update settings or even persist open tabs between sessions.  In extreme cases account can be added and are missing following restarting Thunderbird. </p><p>I see nothing in this discussion about antivirus.  You might want to try uninstalling yours if it is other than Windows defender and see if things improve.  Not windows defender will step in one uninstall a third part product,  you will not be left without protection.  Using your operating system in safe mode with networking will achieve the same thing for the duration of the safe mode, so that is the preferred diagnostic step.  I hate uninstalling and reinstalling anything. </p><p>3. VPN usage.  While the issues here do not indicate a VPN problem  many of the larger providers are attempting to detect fraudulent use of your mail account and many treat a VPN connection very suspiciously. I would suggest not using one while trying to determine what the underlying issues are. </p><p>4. The generally least likely on Windows but still an item to be checked are file permissions.  These are far more relevant on Linux/Unix systems as they have a far more finely implemented set of user permissions than Windows has.  When you select files in your profile and look at the properties.  Do you actually have more than read access to them.  It used to be files copied from CD were by default read only because the CD was read only and that caused issues frequently. CD usage is down,  but the possibility is still there that you do not have the correct write/allocate execute access.   </p><p>Windows displays file access privileges in the security tab of the file properties dialog as shown below. <img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2025-12-20-17-16-19-a48c9e.png"">ile contention whee two applications are attempting to access the same file at the same time resulting in failures in one application or another.  Generally the one that was seeking to modify the content of the file.  In addition to the backup situation there is also the scanning of modified files by virus products,  this becomes a problem when the file in question is huge, as Thunderbird mail files tend to be, and it is also in a streaming backup situation to one drive et. al. </p><p>Now Comcast are in the midst of a very major mail migration to Yahoo,  are you involved in that?  your mail provider has not been mentioned as far as I can see. </p><p>Just how large is your inbox file on disk.  Right click the folder select properties and lok to the size in the dialog. </p><p>Just to add to the complexities of the situation,  modern operating systems have a what I consider sad penchant for cloud backups,  this in itself can cause contention as it actually takes a long time to upload a new copy of a 6Gb inbox file.  Especially when upload speeds are frequently limited to 10% of the advertised download speed of the plan  To illustrate the detail in the <a href=""https://starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1470-99699-90"" rel=""nofollow"">link </a>are for Starlink showing significantly lower upload speeds for all plans.

You would need to logon to the webmaila ccount via a browser and make sure the amazon email address are set up as safe sender, so they do not end up in Spam. Move them to Inbox and then in Thunderbird clickon 'Get Messages' </p><p>Do you have another device eg: phone or computer, connecting to server to see emails? If yes, is it using Imap or Pop&nbsp;? If it uses Pop, then it might be downloading and deleting off the server, so the accounts, Pop or Imap account in Thunderbird cannot download something that has been removed off server. If a pop then make sure it has settings to 'Leave message on server'. </p><p>Maybe you have a filter set up which is altering the view. First check the 'Quick Filter' Select folder - Enable 'Quick Filter'  Are any of the icons showing a blue thin line? If yes, it means it's enabled - click on the icon to switch off the filter. </p><p>Do you have any Message Filters you created&nbsp;? Maybe to move certain emails to other folders or delete etc. If yes, check the 'Filter Log' to see if it moved, deleted etc any emails from Amazon. If filter log is empty then maybe it would be a good idea to select the checkbox 'Enable the filter log' It's possble one of your filters has the type of criteria that may be also catching your Amazon emails. </p><p>Via 'Menu Bar' toolbar - the one with 'File, Edit, View, Go etc Select folder and then check this: View &gt; Threads &gt; 'All' should be selected. </p><p>Check to see if you have inadvertantly set up the Amazon emails as 'ignored' View &gt; Threads &gt; 'All' should be selected, but for a test also select 'Ignored Threads' to see if more emails display. You can uncheck it after if it's not showing anything. Ignored threads will display a red circle type of icon in the thread column.  </p><p>Some people feel they are missing emails and discovered they had 'Threading' enabled. Click on the 'threads' column header to toggle threading on/off to see if the emails appear. </p><p>It's possible the folder index file is not in synch with emails stored in the mbox file. </p> <ul><li> Right click on folder and select 'Properties' </li><li> click on 'Repair Folder' </li><li> click on 'OK' </li></ul> <p>Note: this may force an imap account folder to do a download on that folder.

One is in the GUI windowing environment and is what most Windows refugees will be relying on.  There is another in the underlying system and they do not necessarily talk to one another.  Personally I think it is just another reason the much talked of year of Linux on the desktop is still not here.  They can not standardize on anything and there has to a customization feature to break any standard that does emerge.  But I digress.  You need to examine the locale setting of your system using the command line.

I can turn it off and will do that but something triggered it so this may be a bug because if I have it others probably will too and you may hear from them as well. </p><p>As far as the ""recent destinations"" sort issue, I have to tell you that I am disappointed with the explanation. I have worked in IT for a short while and have always marveled at how many times something is changed in a system that makes it worse and not better: i.e. used to be one click and now it's multiple clicks. Perhaps it was a ""bug"" for someone, but realistically it now takes longer to search and find a recent destination for me since it is no longer alphabetical. The difference is only notable for those of us that move messages to folders daily like me. I don't expect to have this changed back and will have to adjust but maybe it could be a best practice to look at bugs more closely to review their impact before resolving them. Sorry for bending your ear with my rant. I meant no disrespect to what you do. I hope you have a Merry Christmas.  I'll make another donation to the cause the next time you're fund raising to show my gratitude. </p>",romcinsam,false,0,0

You are most unlikely to ever get a definitive answer unless you get it from the mail administrator of one of the domains that did not deliver the mail.

So it is nothing to do with Thunderbird and probably nothing to do with your mail provider but something about the way the email was configured or addressed. </p><p>Quite possibly if the email had and attachment and no body text it could be enough to trigger a spam filter with some providers.

I would feel out of my league posting to the discussion among the designers and coders.   </p><p>Having read the discussion at the bugzilla site, I have some comments based on my extreme dislike of the chronological listing under Move To &gt; Recent Destinations.  </p><p>1) From an <strong>accessibility</strong> point of view, with my vision problems, reading down a list (whether 10 items or 25) in alphabetical order makes scanning much easier because I don't need to read each entry to find the folder name I need.  I can skip to the bottom to start reading more carefully for a folder name that starts with V or W.   There is no mention of accessibility issues in the bugzilla discussion.  Surely that should be a priority? </p><p>2) The suggestion that the resistance from users can be waited out while we become accustomed to the new chronological listing suggests that the problem is with the users, not the design.  Dare I say that this sounds a bit presumptuous?  Surely users and their needs are the raison d’être for Tbird.  For those who see usefulness in the chronological list, perhaps there could be an option for users to choose? </p><p>3) The suggestion that what other apps or OSs do is a consideration or that standardization to their model is desirable is questionable IMO.  Comparing Windows or Libre Office (as the bugzilla poster did) ignores context and function.  What I am trying to do with Move To &gt; Recent Destinations is to quickly file emails I have been reading into their designated folders, singly or in groups.  I.e., to put them away.   </p><p>First and easiest option is to Move To &lt;foldername&gt; Again, assuming that's the last folder I used.  Second option is Move To &gt; Recent Destinations, easy enough with an alphabetical list.  Third option, Move To &gt; Favourites, has an alphabetical listing (with some overlap with Recent Destinations).  In the context, I think it makes sense to have both lists be alphabetical.  Last option, when all else fails, is to work through the alphabetical folder trees under Local Folders.  Again, internal consistency would seem to argue for an alphabetical listing in all three instances since they are variations on the same action.   </p><p>I don't know Libre Office, but what Windows File Explorer is doing in listing recent items I have used is to let me return to that single item.  I.e., retrieve it.  So as far as I can see, not a good comparison to the moving of emails to my Recent Destinations folders.  A comparison to Outlook or Gmail might be more apt, but the reason I use Thunderbird is that it's not Outlook or Gmail.  So, I can't make that comparison. Maybe someone else can. </p>",sllo1,false,0,0

Another, possibly simpler option, is to abandon that email provider and set up a new one. My personal suggestion is to consider <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> because that is free, well-supported, and Outlook provides a user-friendly online client functionality that eliminates the need for a client on the PC. Over the years, I have had several friends and colleagues make that switch and they have been fully content.

What is needed is whatever the email provider requires. That could be server name, port number, authentication,whatever. What you are using is the default that worked in the past, but with the change to Zimbra, we don't know. The best question to ask them is ""What are the server settings to receive and send email?""  And my suggestion to leave that provider I had done previously. You have been working on this for over a month. Nobody here is familiar with that email provider, but we are familiar with many others. I do not recommend an email client, whether Thunderbird or others, if the individual is uncomfortable with dealing in servers, ports, and authentication issue, plus various network errors that periodically occur. My suggestion for Outlook was serious and eliminates the many technical issues that face any email user. If you want to stay with Thunderbird, then I suggest setting up an account with <a href=""http://gmx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmx.com</a>. It's free, it works, and people here are familiar with it.  </p><p>On you question on whether anyone here can assist, the issue is not a Thunderbird issue, it is an email provider issue. You are the customer of that email provider, not thunderbird, not us. They should be able to give you explicit setup instructions for email. They have not. Asking us to figure out what the email provider refuses to share is unfair to us. You are wanting to have someone solve your problem, but it needs your participation. Waiting for your current email setup to be figured out is not my recommendation to resolving this. I do care that you are well served, but that may be best done outside of a PC-based email client. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Here are two: </p> <ol><li> Put your messages in local folders in Thunderbird if they are not there already. In the file system, copy the local folders to an external drive or two. If you are like most users, the messages will be in mbox format. You will be able to import them into Thunderbird and other e-mail clients. You could also read them in apps that do nothing but display mbox messages. Then delete the messages in Thunderbird. </li><li> Get the excellent add-on ImportExportToolsNG and export your messages to an external drive in your choice of six formats. Then delete the messages in Thunderbird. </li></ol> <p>I have many files of mbox messages stored outside Thunderbird on my internal drive and on my back-up drives. These days, when I export messages from Thunderbird, I use the eml format because it is more efficient, maybe less prone to errors, and easy to import into another client that I use occasionally. MBOX may be more common, so you may want to use it. </p><p>When I do these things, I do not bother to compress (zip) the files because there is plenty of room on my drives and I don't want to have to de-compress before accessing the messages again. You can compress if you want to. </p><p>Please ask if you need more details. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

In Thunderbird and in the file system I have a directory Z_History (.sbd in the file system).  This is 14.6GB on a 256GB drive, so significant. I have made no meaningful use of this data in years.  It includes data to 1998.  It is organized in three rough logical blocks: 1) a dozen topic-specific directories for old projects; 2) fourteen directories corresponding to 14 years of archive; and 3) a directory below which are all the pre-2010 folders by year. </p><p>I doubt I will ever need to access any of it at this point, but of course, I doubt want to lose the option.  So, how do the .sbd folders and .msf files work?  Is this structure in Tbird or does it just read what is on disk and display that structure?  I.e. Could I erase everything under Z_History and then, if I needed it, copy the relevant .sbd, .msf, and mail files back to the main disk, restart TBird, and go to town?

But copy/move/delete Z_History, not just what is within it. </p><p>The .msf files are index files used only by Thunderbird. They will not be used if you import the messages into another client. They are also not necessary for future use in Thunderbird because Thunderbird re-creates them as needed. .sbd files are important for maintaining the directory structure. </p><p>The simplest approach is just to copy Z_History in the file system to your back-up location, then delete it from your profile, and re-start Thunderbird. (As long as they are local folders. I am not certain that there would not be complications if you took this approach with server folders.) </p><p>As long as Z_History is saved, you can move it back into your profile for use in Thunderbird or you could import individual mbox files (the ones without an extension) into Thunderbird or into a different e-mail client. </p><p>I have seen situations in which moving such folders back into Thunderbird did not work even though it should have and usually does. I do not know why this process fails sometimes. it may have been because of missing .sbd files. If it fails, that add-on ImportExportToolsNG should do what you need. </p><p>For extra flexibility, you could export folders in eml format in addition to copying/moving Z_History.

You can see this same structure in Thunderbird and in your Thunderbird profile in the file system. So, yes, it is in Thunderbird. And yes, Thunderbird does read it on disk so it can display it within Thunderbird. </p><p>I do not know with certainty, but it may be good to compact the folders before removing them.

For you, I suggest using account settings&gt;copies&amp;folders, and selecting one, and in the account properties, unsubscribe from the other.

To give context, here is some background. I used Juno 4 since email was first available --- probably more than 30 years ago. Last summer, the Juno 4 local client stopped working (the Juno Webmail still works). Thunderbird was the only local email client I could find. As soon as I started using it, it used my Juno email address. That made life much easier than if I would have had to change to a new email address. </p><p>Juno was straightforward and very simple to use. By contrast, Thunderbird has all kinds of bells and whistles which completely baffle me. So that is my background. </p><p>Here are some things I don't understand: </p><p>""Local Folders are folders physically on your computer and not usually associated with accounts."" </p><p>1. Juno 4 was a POP client so all emails were stored physically on my computer. I have many thousands of stored emails. Thunderbird is unclear as to whether or not it is POP.

I just have G-mail and I use Thunderbird to see it on my computer and just the regular mail app on the two apple devices.  The weird thing was it happened a while ago and I called Apple.  The man was super helpful and helped me with a recovery tool.  It brought back all my old deleted files, but the missing video was not in it.  It was alot of busy work to go through everything only to find that wasn't there.  So he figured it was something wrong with the G-mail server.  I don't know how long G-mail keeps things on server, but I have some e-mails that I have saved for years, so it must not have a limit.  I don't want my devices deleting things automatically.

IMAP is a technology that keeps the messages on the server; that is useful if the user uses more than one PC or also uses phone for email access. POP keeps everything on the user's PC.  </p><p>An account is the setup for one email address. Thunderbird can handle an unlimited number of accounts.

Thunderbird keeps all messages separate for each.  </p><p>Subfolders can be helpful if you want to isolate some messages into groups for later review.

Rogers uses Yahoo for its e-mail services, so the names of both Rogers and Yahoo appear in the message that you see. That's not a problem. If you are no longer a Rogers customer, you can no longer access your e-mail account with them. Thunderbird's attempt to log you in using old account information that is still in Thunderbird fails because you are no longer a Rogers customer and your account with them has been closed. So Rogers cannot help you because you are no longer a customer. </p><p>That's all logical. What puzzles me is that you can sign in to <a href=""http://yahoo.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.ca</a>.

I still have the three pane view of my mail I had when using version2  with essentially the same lists. Everything has been replaced and someone thought a multi line mail list would be good.

The more your brother-in-law has used his computer since the account deletion, the less successful the recovery will be. There is a slight chance that the deletion of the mail was not synchronized with the server, so the messages or some of them are still on the server. To check, you will want to log in to his mail account on the e-mail service provider's website. But you will need a new password for that, so  …  </p><p>For #2: You should contact the e-mail service provider for instructions on re-setting the password. The instructions should also be on their website.  </p><p>For #3: Setting up the account again is easy. You will want to get the following information from the e-mail service provider for <strong>both</strong> the incoming and the outgoing server: </p><p>Server name Port Connection security Authentication method User name (usually the full e-mail address) </p><p>You should find out whether or not third-party e-mail clients such as Thunderbird need an app-specific (or ""security"" or ""application"") password to access the mail server. If they do, you'll have to generate one and use it in Thunderbird in place of the account password. </p><p>Once you have that information, create a new account in Thunderbird with it.

Can I enter/establish a DIFFERENT password for my outbound emails?  Thank you. </blockquote> <p>You would have to ask you mail provider.  Apparently that is Ultimately Yahoo and they have required outgoing passwords for as long as I have had a Yahoo account that could send mail outside of the Yahoo website.  Probably dating to around 2010 I would guess. </p><p>But let me put it this way.  Knowing your email address, and it is hardly a secret, I could send mail from your providers server pretending to be you legitimately unless thay ask for credentials.  This is not about hacking,  this is about the sender proving they have a legitimate right to send mail using that email address on that server.  To not require authentication would make the server an open relay.  I will point you to Wikipedia to explain what that is and why it is a horrible idea. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_mail_relay"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_mail_relay</a> </p><p>You apparently think for some reason that Xfinity did not require a password and that something new is being asked of you.  Xfinity always required a sending password.  Thunderbird may have memorized it when you sent your first email,  but you could not send mail from an xfinity account without authentication ever.  I would suggest you read the support pages at Xfinity for information on the requirement <a href=""https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/email-client-programs-with-xfinity-email"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/email-client-programs-with-xfinity-email</a> </p><p>Perhaps this misunderstanding is derived from the concept of logging in.  You do not do it when you open Thunderbird and that grants you access to everything comcast/xfinity regarding email until you close Thunderbird like is the experience on their website.  It happens multiple times in most sessions.  When you open Thunderbird it immediately reaches out to get your new mail.  That is the default and it authenticates with the incoming mail server either <a href=""http://mail.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.comcast.net</a> for pop mail accounts or <a href=""http://imap.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.comcast.net</a> for IMAP mail accounts.  Once the new mail is collected the program signs off from the server.  That session is done.  15 minutes or so latter(depending on user settings in account settings, Thunbird again signs into the server to get any new mail that has arrived for that account.  When you click send, Thunderbird authenticates with the outgoing mail server <a href=""http://smtp.comcast.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.comcast.net</a> and asks to submit mail for delivery.  Once that is completed then Thunderbird signs out from the server, until there is a need to send more mail.   </p><p>The new xfinity arrangement with Yahoo changes that in so much as the servers names are changed,  and the authentication method also goes to oAuth with uses a token supplied by the server instead of your password at each connection.  With oAuth, Thunderbird never actually knows your real password.  It is entered in the initial authentication process where you grant Thunderbird access to your mail  but it is not saved at all. Instead of the password being saved the token provided by Yahoo is saved and used instead of your password until Yahoo decides the token requires you to validate your continued acquiescence to Thunderbird accessing your mail by forcing a new permission.  that might be years from now (my experience) or a matter of hours from the permission, depending on your use of VPN products and use of public internet connection points and you movements but that is decided entirely by Yahoo.  Thunderbird gets no say when the token provided revokes the permission, other than to walk you through the permission process again. </p><p>just to attempt clarity.  Your ""Thunderbird account"" can only be hacked if your local  machine is compromised as Thunderbird stores no information at all anywhere but on your local machine, or in the case of Mobile, on your phone.   </p><p>You do not have a ""Thunderbird account"" as suc,h in the way I feel you are thinking of it, like you have a Facebook or eBay account.  You have a collection of files on your local machine which stores information about your mail accounts, authentication protocols and your mail.  There is no web presence to be hacked.

And what type of account was set up in Thunderbird — IMAP or POP? </p><p>Case 1: If he deleted his Thunderbird profile, then everything that was only in his profile is gone, including messages that were stored in local folders. But everything that was also on the server should still be on the server. And you or he can use either webmail or Thunderbird to access them and to send and receive messages. </p><p>Case 2: If he deleted messages that were stored in server folders on Thunderbird, then they were deleted from the server too, so you will not be able to access them. However, some e-mail service providers keep back-ups, and some for only a short while. My e-mail service provider keeps a back-up copy of deleted messages for seven days. If the deleted messages are important, ask your e-mail service provider for help. </p><p>Your description of what happened makes me think that Case 1 is the situation, so I am optimistic ... unless important messages were stored only in local folders. The best situation would be that the account was set up in Thunderbird as an IMAP account (not POP), and your brother-in-law kept all messages in IMAP folders, not local folders. </p><p>In any case, you should be able to set the account up again in Thunderbird, if you think that that would be better than using webmail. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

[...]      I believe the current computer will take the 64-bit Thunderbird. Do you think I should consider installing that? On top of the existing Thunderbird or should I uninstall first? Either way, could I restore the profile with the 64-bit when the profile was made on a 32-bit? And what does restoring from the backup actually do? Would I expect to find all three of my accounts (the POP and the two IMAPs) and all their folders and messages? I wonder if I should take the time to rebuild all the .msf files before taking any drastic action and maybe do another profile backup. (I'd hate to lose things because I restored from an incomplete backup.) Obviously, I wish I knew what is causing the failure. It seems like a very specific, targeted problem, but with nothing pointing to the broken link in the chain that normally keeps everything flowing.  &gt; (By the way, ""webmail"" refers to a Web-based user interface to e-mail.

I use Thunderbird as well at my home, have done for many years as well. On their advice and with their help I accessed his Email, via Spark's Webmail.

You want that option. You do not want to import the all mail folder. So I suggest that you re-do the take out process and get a file for each label. </p><p>After that, as Matt wrote, you do not want to use the import function in Thunderbird. So no ""import from a file"" or ""import backed up profile"" or ""choose a ZIP file"" or file type=Outlook. Here's what you want to do instead: </p><p>Unzip the take out file. You should see an mbox file for each gmail label. </p><p>The easiest way to get mbox files into Thunderbird is by copying them in the file system. You want to put them in the ""Local folders"" directory of your profile. Close Thunderbird, copy the files, re-start Thunderbird. To find where your profile is on disk, Help (menu) &gt; Troubleshooting information &gt; ""Profile folder"" in the first table &gt; ""Show in [...]"" </p><p>I have seen this procedure fail because Thunderbird did not recognize the imported files. Make sure that the files do not have an extension.

When you try to read emails on your laptop Gmail will send a request to your phone saying a new device is trying to connect to Gmail. You must answer the question on your phone telling that is you trying to connect using a new device. Gmail will then let your laptop read and have access to your Gmail account. This stops people who don't have your phone from reading your emails because on another device. They can't answer the question with out your phone to tell Gmail it is you trying to connect with a new device. I think this is the same with all email systems. So leave your phone on when you connect with a new device so you can tell Gmail it is you trying to connect. It's a pain in the rear end.  Hope this works for you because I had the same problem.

I've sent a reply to you and hopefully you should see both images in the reply. </p><p>When inserting inline image&nbsp;: Insert &gt; Image If you choose to select 'Alternative text' option The type of content required is a simple text description of image in a few words.  </p><p>After ensuring your inline images do not have incorrect data in the Alternative text option - I suggest you do a retest of send and reply responding using an iphone. Then at least you know your original email containing inline images has been correctly inserted. </p>,Toad-Hall,false,0,0

All of the issues happened after I did one of your latest updates.

One possible interpretation is: After the ugprade to 146, you did not see local folders in Thunderbird and incoming/outgoing mail did not work, but you ""brought back"" incoming/outgoing mail by setting up one of your accounts again. (Your ""before"" screen image shows two accounts. Your ""after"" screen image shows only one.) That, however, did nothing about the mail in local folders, which still did not appear in Thunderbird. So you took some action to get your local folders showing again, but it's not clear what you did. Maybe you made a copy of something. Some messages from local folders may have ended up in a trash folder because your local folders trash folder is much larger than it used to be. </p><p>How accurate is that interpretation or how probable is that course of events? </p><p>Please go to the Help menu &gt; Troubleshooting information &gt; about:profiles, make a screen image of what appears next on your screen (information about one or more profiles) and post it here. </p><p>Then, if you have more than one profile, note which one is the default.

Some other sites claim that Juno provides IMAP accounts too. To see what kind of account you have, right click on the account name in the folder pane, select ""Settings"", then, on the next screen, click on ""Server settings"" on the left and note the account type at the top of the right pane. If you have IMAP, you set your account up wrong. We can guide you in switching to POP.

Many factors inside and outside Thunderbird can cause data loss. Many factors can cause data loss elsewhere on your computer. Drives fail. People delete things accidentally. Anti-virus software screws things up. Etc. The advice to make back-up copies does not imply that one application is more prone to data loss than another application. </p><p>3.

No details of the account have been posted, and it seems a waste of time without that from him. The Juno site indicates that Juno 5 supports POP and IMAP that seems the safest road, especially since he has so many folders. The work to possibly convert and import all the folders seems a big task since I am not aware even of the Juno folder format. This looks iike a rabbithole, lacking facts. It isn't our responsibility to know his account settings.  </p><p>To Joe,  - click to 'account settings' menu - click 'server settings' link in left side.  if the right side of screen says IMAP, then the account is IMAP. if you do not want IMAP, then delete the account. then, start over and create a new account and be sure to specify POP during setup  - once you have the account working, you can investigate importing folders. to do that, and receive assistance, you need to do a screenshot of the Juno folders as they appear in Windows File Explorer. That will let people here make suggestions on what might work. If the file structure appears to be the same as used by Thunderbird, then a detailed (somewhat tedious) process will allow you to transfer all folders to thunderbird. we can help in providing steps to do that. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

The junk filter in Thunderbird has to be trained.” I thought that is what I was doing. What should I do to train it? For example, if I designate email from a specific email address as junk, Thunderbird still puts emails from that address in my inbox. Thunderbird also arbitrarily puts emails NOT designated as junk in the Junk box. </p><p>2 POP and IMAP. I know that Juno is POP because all email downloaded to the Juno client is removed from the server. That is not the case with Thunderbird. Yet, Thunderbird documentation is vague about whether it is POP or IMAP. How can I set it to POP (respectively to IMAP)? </p><p>Regarding backups, I have all my data on a separate drive --- J:\ This includes installable applications, so if my C:\ drive becomes corrupted and Windows needs to be reinstalled, I can reinstall my applications. </p><p>Juno is on the J drive with a simple path: J:\Juno I would like to do that with Thunderbird. </p><p>3. ""C:\Users\User\Appdata\Roaming\Thunderbird I don’t buy into Microsoft’s trip. For example, I use Windows 7 and I have tweaked Windows 7 so that most of its stupid “features” have been removed or disabled. This would be difficult to do with Windows 10 and impossible with Windows 11 and beyond. I may just try to copy Thunderbird to the location I want and see whether I can make it work. </p><p>4. POP and IMAP --- I have commented on this above. You wrote “Local folders are not POP but they are similar.” </p><p>That kind of vague language is exactly what is problematic to me about this topic. What do you mean here? </p><p>5. Do you mean that you have hundreds of folders in the discontinued Juno application? Not on the server, right? Yes. You seem to want local folders in Thunderbird, either associated with your POP account or on their own. </p><p>I still do not know whether I have a POP account. I still do not know what a local folder is. Also, what do you mean by “on their own”? </p><p>They are easy to create. Right click on either your account name in the folder pane or on ""Local Folders"" in the folder pane, and select ""New folder"". I still do not know what a local folder is. Do you want to move the mail from the Juno application to Thunderbird? I do not intend to put my many thousands of old messages from Juno on to Thunderbird. All I want to do is make subfolders, BUT I need to know what a local folder is and what other kind of folder there is. </p>",slemberg,false,0,0

Regarding Juno 5, I tried this many years ago and it was POP. I went back to Juno 4 because Juno 5 was somewhat unstable and also encrypted the messages so that lost messages could not be recovered. The disadvantage for me with Juno 4 was that the Inbox size is limited to 1000 messages, so I had to frequently create new folders based on date.

You do not want any data to exist in only one location. </p><p>What about David's explanation of local folders did you not understand? I used the wording that I did because David had already explained it and I was just responding to your conflation of POP accounts and local folders. Look at the folder pane in Thunderbird. You will see ""Local Folders"". That's it. It is a place where you can create folders to store messages that will exist only on your computer's drive, not on a server and not associated with any e-mail address. Such folders in Thunderbird can exist in two places: the local folders ""account"", where they have no conection to an e-mail address, and a POP account, where they are associated with an e-mail address. By ""on their own"", I meant not associated with an e-mail address. </p><p>I told you how to create a local folder: right click on ""Local Folders"" in the folder pane, and select ""New folder"".
