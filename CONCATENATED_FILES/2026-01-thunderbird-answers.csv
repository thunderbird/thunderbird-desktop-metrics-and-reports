In general, Thunderbird does not support or debug addons; that is the developer role. Also, by using the latest release, you are more likely to encounter addon issues, as developers must be continually involved with latest updates. it is routine for users to post that an addon isn't working properly with the latest release. If reliable results from addons is a priority, my personal recommendation is to stick with the ESR release. My opinion - and it's nothing more than that - is that the developer has direct contact with the appropriate persons and could probably work through this issue better.

I have been frustrated beyond belief and this has ""almost"" restored my sanity! </p><p>That setting must be fairly new.

I have not looked closely at what else may be going on with those server entries, but I have never seen them disappear like that in previous ""new"" setups. </p><p>Any insights on what could be creating that ""other"" new craziness? </p><p>FWIW, and not knowing how much text I can fit in this ""box,"" I feel compelled to share something I think you will understand completely!  Here goes a CUT/PASTE I hope works!&nbsp;:-) </p><p>I suspect the font and any character colors will be altered, but I have to try. </p> <h6 id=""w_"">=====================================================================================</h6> <p>Early in my career as an entrepreneur of IT ventures, I coined a phrase by which I have lived ever since, and I believe to be true to this day - almost 50 years later: </p><p>""Friendship is the currency of life,"" and I spend it freely.  </p><p>My returns have been exponential, which is why I believe it to be true; and it all stems from a simple premise:  Whether I meet you for the first time via this media, a phone call or in person ... when I ask you to be my friend, two circumstances arise, immediately.  </p><p>You can say ""No,"" and I have lost nothing. We weren't friends prior; so nothing changes.  (Although you have lost an opportunity for a great, long lasting friendship.) </p><p>Or you can say ""Yes,"" and a world of possibilities begins!  It becomes even easier, if you can adopt my perspective:  I look at you as a lifelong friend; but we both have an ""amnesia of sorts"" ... because we lack the natural history that would have been ours had we been boyhood pals.  Thus, from this day forward, we have every opportunity to enjoy life as friends and/or colleagues ... building our ""new memories"" and natural history.  </p><p>The reward?  Not only a great friendship; but - for those who can ""handle it"" - and they are truly few and unique to be sure - an immediate opportunity to be candid, frank and honest about all we have to say to one another ... rather than searching for the politically or socially correct language. </p><p>A freedom of expression found only among GOOD &amp; BEST FRIENDS. (I love that freedom!) </p><p>I found the page below from an article written in 2009 - long after the events in my life, circa 1976, which gave me the above insights ... and I feel it states my thoughts VERY well. Sadly, I didn't capture the author's name for attribution. </p> <h6 id=""w__2"">=====================================================================================</h6> <p>FRIENDSHIP AND THE ""SERVICE"" IT REQUIRES </p><p>Friendships are not - or should not be - considered casual, insignificant events in life. Those are called Acquaintances.  </p><p>Friendship implies a bond between two or more people that represents an enduring quality - founded on similar interests, mutual enjoyment of one another and those interests, and above all, TRUST. </p><p>Would you give your TRUST to just anyone?  If the answer is ""Yes,"" you do not understand the principles described herein.  (This is the only precept with which I disagree ... given the caveat that ""it is not trusting someone with my life!""  I believe you should trust everyone ... until they prove unworthy.  Those people usually show their 'true colors' before long - intended or otherwise.  There is far too much distrust or suspicion in the world today, IMHO.) </p><p>Good friends enjoy all of the above. A best friend, and there can truly be only ONE, not many, also enjoys a confidence that is founded on that TRUST - all of which relies on complete and total HONESTY!  </p><p>That is why - when good and best friends have been apart for any length of time, they can resume as if no gap in time existed. For those too shy - or even too foolish - to recognize it, it is all based on LOVE. For oneself and those to whom we ENTRUST our friendship. </p><p>That is why a FRIENDSHIP is NOT a casual event.  It matters greatly and should be dealt with accordingly.  </p><p>Friendship is not work; but it does and should require service.  It's called PARTICIPATION and it has to come from both parties; but no judgment as to the ""amount"" of participation should ever be assessed.  (Those, who have visited our home as dinner guests, have all heard me say this: ""Thank you for your participation!"") </p><p>It's called doing the best you can!  </p><p>There will always be dissimilar schedules and other life-events that keep friends apart - but those are NOT lapses in friendship; rather (almost painful) separation from a dear friend!  These periods of separation should never be off-putting. Disappointing, even sad, but never a feeling that the bond has been broken. </p><p>Only by verbal, face to face encounters should friendships be ended ... with reason(s); never by assumption. </p><p>Thus, if I am unable to fulfill an expectation or seem to be ever-unavailable, it is OK to ask ""Why?!"" If the answer is unacceptable, then a solution needs to be worked out. If it means the end of the friendship, the bond was not what you thought, hoped for - or wanted. </p><p>Termination occurs. That is why finding and keeping GOOD friends and a BEST friend is so important.  (And not being shy about telling those you care about ... that you do!  Too often, and often too soon, that opportunity is taken away from all of us!) </p><p>If you understand, as I do, that events can keep friends apart - often for long periods of time - but their hearts remain committed to one another ... then all is well ... and will resume again, as noted above.  </p><p>Never be fearful of Friendship ... just learn to notice - and accept - the difference between it and an Acquaintance. The former will always endure. Embrace its continuum - few things in life are as good.&nbsp;:-) </p> <h6 id=""w__3"">=====================================================================================</h6> <p>Needless to say, I am delighted this worked, albeit with some ""emphasis from color"" omitted. </p><p>""Thank you, again, Rick"" for being my man among men for 2026! </p>",tkg1cpmg,false,0,0

Some people do like it, but I've never needed another program just to sift through emails. Thunderbird does have it's own methods of scannning and sorting mail by training the adaptive spam/junk mail controls and using Message Filters.  New incoming mail can only be scanned if it is still in the 'Inbox' and has not been previously sorted via webmail filters into other folders. </p><p>You cannot change a current Imap account into a Pop account as it's set up is completely different. You can create a new account for same email address and set it up as Pop. </p><p>Some servers will need you to select to allow the Pop download options. This can only be done via the webmail account. So worth checking Pop is enabled/allowed in webmail before you start. </p><p>Pop accounts can only access the server Inbox and download whatever is in that folder. Pop accounts do not synchronise any folder with the server. They can be considered as completely independent of the server as all emails are stored on your computer assuming you download full copies.Obviously, as all incoming new mail will be in the Inbox, Thunderbird's adaptive spam controls would scan all incoming mail.  </p><p>Please note - anything the server filters deems as spam will be put into the server Spam folder and therefore will never be seen by any Pop account.  </p><p>That means anything in the server Inbox as seen in Imap account can easily be downloaded again into Pop account.   Assuming your Imap account has a load of other folders containing emails, this presents a problem. </p><p>Emails in other server folders eg: Sent or anything you created, cannot be seen by Pop account. There are few methods you could use. I've mentioned three below. It really depends upon how many folders and how many emails are involved. If not too many because most are in Inbox, then method 1 may be ok. If a few folders but not loads, then you could try method 2. If you have a ton of emails in loads of folders then it might be a lot quicker to do a manul copy paste of files directly - use method 3. </p><p><strong>1.</strong> Access webmail account and move emails from a folder into the 'Inbox' and then in Thunderbird pop account click on 'Get Messages' to download them. Then you create a new folder in  Pop account and move those emails into the new folder. Repeat for each folder - this is not exactly that quick, but it depends upon how many folders and emails you are talking about. Ideal if not too many. </p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Create suitably named folders in the 'Local Folders' mail account. Make sure you have got full downloaded copies of all emails: Using the 'Menu Bar' toolbar (it's not enabled by default so you might need to enable it) </p> <ul><li> 'File' &gt; 'Offline' &gt; 'Download/sync now' </li><li> Select 'Mail Messages' </li><li> click on 'Select' </li><li> Suggest you also select 'Work offline once download and or synchronisation is complete' </li><li> For the imap account, select all the checkboxes for all the folders where you want to have full downloads of all emails and click on 'OK' </li><li> Then click on 'OK' to start the sync. </li></ul> <p>Once complete, you should be in offline mode so that nothing can interfer with the next process. </p> <ul><li> Highlight batches of emails </li><li> Right click on highlighted emails </li><li> select 'COPY-TO' and choose an appropriate folder in the 'Local Folders' account.  </li><li> Repeat until you have copies of all emails in the Local Folders account. </li></ul> <p>Advise you always use Copy-to just in case something goes wrong - you can easily repeat the action. This means you end up with all your previously sorted emails now stored in 'Local Folders' and fully accessible. Do check you can select randon emails to test you really can read the content.

You assume learning has something to do with the message sender and it does not.  </p><p>I do not use SpamAssassin,  or I should say my provider does not and it is something that the mail provider supports and runs on the mail server.  Thunderbirds only role in that is to read the header SpamAssassin sets and honor its decision.  Perhaps SpamAssassin is no longer treating those email as spam so Thunderbird is not either or perhaps your mail provider does not actually support SpamAssassin.  Thunderbird will let you set the filter even if it never sees a header to act on.  I can not really comment if you provider uses SpamAssassin as you make no mention of who that is.  But Microsoft, Google Yahoo and GMX do not use SpamAssassin.

So if profile stuff is here&nbsp;: C://Users/username/Appdata/Roaming/<strong>Thunderbird</strong> In Anti-Virus - Create an exception to not scan that 'Thunderbird' folder. </p><p>AV's have a habit of checking every file that gets opened and scanning stuff. When you download, a file gets opened to write to the file, when you send a file gets opened to save the sent email etc and also there is communication downloading uploading to server.  That can have a performance issue - hence why testing a restart in 'Safe Mode with Networking' to see if it really is interfering. </p><p>So, either create the exception to not scan profile OR do the restart test. </p><p>Please note - if you just stop Malware Bytes then the Windows 11 Anti-Virus will kick in - hence the ideal is to test in 'Safe Mode with Networking'. </p><p>Whilst you are at it ... Firewall - it might be controlled by Windows or by an Anti-virus. Access Firewall and make sure Thunderbird program has been set up as allowed. </p><p>Also check computer for a VPN which may have been enabled by you or by an Anti-Virus product. Switch it off. </p><p>Then restart Thunderbird </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

Seriously.  if you are downloading mail using Thunderbird with the IMAP protocol you are not making something that could be considered a long term archive in any way shape or form.

Basically it is another instance of trying to bend the tool to the function rather than use an archiving tool.  Some will tell you it works like a charm.  Others will say it has problems and et others will say it has lots of problems don't touch it.  One thing is apparent, the larger your individual emails the higher the risk that the filters will timeout while in processing  the mail and will not be removed, will be copied multiple times or just plain lost from the server or other anomalous issues surface.  There is no real automated guaranteed solution. </p><p>The best solution is to archive on the server and periodically make backup of the contents of the archived folders in Thunderbird using the importexport tool and then delete the mails from the archive folders. <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools-ng/?src=ss</a> </p><p>I recommend mbox backup files that you name for the time they represent say June2025 and july2025.

Their archiving possibilities are limited and each e-mail address has a limited space allocation, so I want to archive old messages outside that allocation.   Yes I use IMAP and access e-mail on different devices, but will be happy if I can persuade Thunderbird to move (or at least copy) them on to the drive of my main Windows 11 computer.  I.e. actually create files on he computer.   So that they are (or can be) removed from the server.  </p><p>But so far specifying 'Local copy' in Thunderbird has only managed to expand my CPanel directory  structure to: </p><p>Inbox </p><pre>  Archive 2022   Archive 2023 </pre> <p>and the 'archived' messages still count against my allocation.

Here is my first suggestion:  - for each account, go to 'account settings' and click the 'server settings's pane, and check the profile shown in the 'Local Folders' row at bottom of screen.  - repeat that for Local Folders.  - are they all in the default profile, or are some in different profiles? This can happen if you have moved accounts through the years.  - if all are in the default profile, then the other profiles are possibly old ones from previous upgrades. I suggest reviewing the folders within them and the date last modified. Thunderbird only points to one profile, never two. If all accounts and local folders are in the default profile, you don't need the others.  Since they are not being used, you could safely delete them. To be safe and protect from error, you might - exit thunderbird - move the other profiles elsewhere - restart thunderbird and verify that all accounts and Local Folders are ok. </p>",davidsk,false,1,0

Nonetheless, I think there should be another way to actually block received emails more easily than creating a lot of filters. It would seem that a default filter could be applied to an email which is received by a Thunderbird user by some mechanism that each time a new spam email is received, the TBird user could click on that email, and it would simply add that email address to the spam/block list. After the first application to that received address by the User click, the email address would be filtered thereafter without having to be manually clicked by the TBird user. I am not a programmer, but I would strongly expect that this mechanism approach could be created. On a separate issue, I think you might have seen an image which seemed to be applied to the communication by Mozzilla. I sent the question to you by opening the Firefox browser, it was not sent to you by Thunderbird. I can not find the original communication I sent to you, but I do recall that there was some image that seemed to have a very small image related to either Firefox or Mozilla; it also had some very small text. I did not examine either one. If that is the image you are referring to, I did not apply it myself, nor did I examine it before I sent the link to you from Firefox. I am not aware that there was any other image you might be referring to. If so, it would have to be something I did not either insert or see. Thank you again for you response Rick. I will say that I will be investigating an alternative email app that might address the automatic blocking of identified spam. </blockquote> <p>You can right click on the sender's e-mail address and select ""Create filter from"" in the drop-down menu. That will filter messages, not block the sender. </p><p>Look above for the screen image that you must have posted. </p><p>Yes, I understand that you are using Firefox. One must use this forum in a browser window. You cannot send messages to the forum from Thunderbird. You get e-mail messages notifying you of new messages in the discussion. There are two links to the discussion in each notification message. There's no need to use private messages. </p><p>As I said, for ""automatic blocking"", you will need to use webmail or an e-mail client from a firm that controls server and client, e.g., Microsoft. Thunderbird can filter. Now you know a shortcut for creating a filter. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

As to your suggestion that I can make the transferred profile work by deleting pkcs11.txt and compatibility.ini, I did some research on the dichotomy between the ******.profile and the ******.profile-default folders. Some of the advice on the web contradicts other advice on this point. I may not have ""the"" picture, but I now have a clear idea of ""a"" picture here. I have tried following your instructions with the transfer of various combinations of these folders, but, unfortunately, none of them work. All lead to that dreaded octopus page.

This can happen if you have moved accounts through the years.  - if all are in the default profile, then the other profiles are possibly old ones from previous upgrades.

If all accounts and local folders are in the default profile, you don't need the others.  Since they are not being used, you could safely delete them.

Click on the ""launch profile"" button and have a look at when it contains rather than trying to work it out from the file system.  Personally I use multiple profiles.  Especially when I am messing around with very old Thunderbird versions like 3.  because I do not want to mess up anything in the profile I use every day.  Multiple profile can also occur if you use multiple versions of Thunderbird. See <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profile-thunderbird-installation</a> although I find Thunderbird just looses the plot occasionally and asks you to set it up all over again.  Those that know can force the use of the existing profile.  But most do not even realize what has happened until their contacts have not shown up or whatever caused the profile to be lost also prevents the adding of the email account in the new profile.   Note that there is no launch  button for the profile you are using to get to the about:profiles page.  Once you are satisfies you do not want a particular profile you can use the corresponding button to delete it. </blockquote> <p>I've been to about profiles and have realized that most (the small ones) do not have a Mail folder, but one has a 3.5 Gb mail folder.

In the instructions you sent me Mr Toad, you said to ensure that Thunderbird was not running on either machine when the file manipulations are done. I certainly have ensured that Thunderbird was not running on the Mint machine, but I was not 100% sure that I had closed it on the Win7. So I just went through it all again. I transferred only lu4hnubh.default-release, and deleted the two files as instructed. It didn't work, and I got the octopus screen again. When I powered up Thunderbird, there was only lu4hnubh.default-release in the ,thunderbird directory. Immediately afterwards, it had this: drwx------  8 richard richard 12288 Jan 13 20:33 5c3cd7li.default-release drwx------  3 richard richard  4096 Jan 13 20:33 Crash Reports -rw-rw-r--  1 richard richard     0 Jan 13 20:41 folder_listing.txt -rw-rw-r--  1 richard richard    62 Jan 13 20:33 installs.ini drwxr-xr-x 14 richard richard 12288 Jan 13 20:32 lu4hnubh.default-release drwx------  2 richard richard  4096 Jan 13 20:33 Pending Pings -rw-rw-r--  1 richard richard   259 Jan 13 20:33 profiles.ini drwx------  2 richard richard  4096 Jan 13 20:33 x7aum95y.default </p><p>Note that there are TWO xxxxxx.default-release folders. It seems that the Mint Thunderbird has just made its own and ignored the seed. You wrote that either the default or the default-release folder would do, which seemed to imply that they are roughly equivalent. On my Win7 system, OisOy8wr.default is 18.5GB whereas lu4hnubh.default-release is only 16.1 MB If the profile can fit in 16.1 MB, then what can Thunderbird be doing to take up 18.5GB in the other folder?

The changes don't work at all, only the ones I make to the servers in Account Settings &gt; Outgoing Server:{pick one of the saved configurations} &gt; ""Edit outgoing server..."". That is, changes done to the configuration of the selected Outgoing Server are saved. However, as soon as I switch to another section (e.g. Server Settings), this field reverts back to ""Outgoing Server: Use Default Server"". Thus, I can only really use the Default Server as outgoing server. I also can't create new configurations for new outgoing servers, only the ones that were already saved are there, there are no buttons to create a new outgoing server config. </p><p>Also, if I change the color, or the account name, or try to delete the account, nothing changes, even before restarting Thunderbird. That's why I think none of the changes on the Account Settings page I screenshot are saved, but the ones in subpages (like Server Settings and Spam Settings) seem to be working, though I haven't tried altering them for fear of breaking them. </p><p>In regard to Thunderbird not shutting down: <strong>I did find multiple prefs.js files inside my profile folder</strong>, prefs.js, prefs-2.js, prefs-3.js, prefs-4.js.

As far as transferring the messages, That's probably best done by you.If volume is small, you may be able to simply highlight the account folders, rightclick and select 'COPY to' the gmail account.

A safe way is to use file&gt;offline&gt;download to ensure you capture all messages, use the addon, importexporttools NG to highlight folder, righclick, export to mbox file, and then highlight Local Folders, rightclick and use the importexportoption to import mbox. That gets the messages safely to your PC, Check that you have all the content, not just headers. Now, you can highlight the local messages, select COPY to ' the gmail folders.

Outlook si je vede po svém, Thunderbird po svém a při synchronizaci se nepřekládají. „Opravit složku“ to jen dorazí, protože si složku znovu postaví z metadat na serveru, kde ty příznaky nejsou v odpovídajícím tvaru. </p><p><strong>Co je příčina</strong> Exchange ukládá metadata o odpovědi/přeposlání jako MAPI/PR_* flagy, případně v ExtendedProperties (tzv. PR_LAST_VERB_*). IMAP má zase svůj \Answered a \Forwarded. OAuth2 konektor v TB 145–146 nepřekládá MAPI → IMAP a zpět. Výsledek je, že TB při čtení nevidí flagy a při zápisu je neuloží do schématu, které Outlook umí přečíst. Kopírování zprávy v TB zachová interní flag, ale ten není uložen na serveru ve tvaru, který by Outlook poznal. </p><p><strong>Stav 2026</strong> Zatím není implementováno plné mapování MAPI „verb flags“. Na bugzille existují otevřené reporty pro „exchange verbs“ a „last verb executed“. Chování „Opravit složku“ (Rebuild) je konzistentní: přepíše lokální flagy daty ze serveru, takže všechno zmizí. </p><p><strong>Jak řešit bod 1 a 2 (prakticky dnes)</strong> Realisticky jsou jen tři funkční varianty: </p><p>1. psát/dokončovat vlákna v TB (145+) a nikdy nepoužívat „Opravit složku“ u projektových složek, aby zůstaly lokální flagy; 2. psát/dokončovat vlákna výhradně v Outlooku (desktop), čímž se flagy ukládají serverově a TB je zatím ignoruje, ale Outlook je vidí; 3. přejít na EAS/EWS bridge (DavMail, grommunio-ews apod.), který umí mapovat „last verb“ → IMAP flags. </p><p><strong>Bod 3 – kopie se symbolem jen v TB</strong> To je lokální flag TB. Outlook se dívá na MAPI a tam nic není, takže nezobrazí. </p><p><strong>Co s bodem 4</strong> To odpovídá variantě (1): nově odeslané přes TB se zapíší tak, aby TB viděl flag. Outlook to stále nečte plně. </p><p><strong>Co lze očekávat do budoucna</strong> Dokud nebude implementace Exchange connectoru doplněna o mapování „LastVerbExecuted“ a „LastVerbExecutionTime“ do/ze serveru, budou flagy mezi Outlook ↔ TB asynchronní. Vývoj TB v roadmapě uvedl, že „verbs“ jsou v backlogu, ale zatím bez termínu. </p><p><strong>Doporučení pro tvoji situaci (komunikační projekty + vlákna)</strong> Pokud jsou pro tebe klíčové symboly v obou klientech, nejméně bolestivé je: A) dokončovat vlákna v Outlooku a kontrolovat v Outlooku; TB používat jen jako čtení/reakce s vědomím, že symboly v TB neznamenají nic serverově; B) nebo přes EWS bridge (např. DavMail), kde se používaly EWS „verbs“ a flagy se uchovaly lépe než v čistém OAuth2 konektoru. </p><p><strong>Co by pomohlo vývojářům</strong> Aby byl bug uzavřen, TB musí implementovat: </p> <ul><li> čtení MAPI PR_LAST_VERB_EXECUTED; </li><li> mapování na \Answered/\Forwarded; </li><li> zápis zpět při odeslání (SMTP+MAPI update); </li><li> potlačení destruktivního rebuildu pro tyto flagy. </li></ul> <p><strong>Závěr</strong> Pro bod 1–3 dnes neexistuje čisté nastavení v TB, protože chybí mapování „verb flags“ Exchange ↔ IMAP. Výsledek, který chceš (symbole v obou klientech, beze ztráty při „Opravit složku“) vyžaduje změnu v TB. Do té doby je nutné volit workflow (TB-only, Outlook-only, nebo EWS bridge). </p>",poljos-moz,false,0,0

The filters are all set up in Thunderbird, and I'm not aware of the ability to have them resident on either the server or Thunderbird per se, but the *results* of the filters vary: a (very) few filters actually download messages to Local Folders on my laptop, but since that means I could easily lose those in a hardware crash or update (ignoring backups), most of the filters file messages on server-based folders, of which there are a LOT.  </p> <ul><li> The rogue Folder BS has now stored messages originating from some or all of the sources listed above. I should add that legit BS-related traffic is focused around traffic generated by the organization's domain hosted at Siteground per 4. above, and forwarded to a server-based folder in the mailbox for the most heavily used address in 1. above. The problem is that Folder BS is now sucking up messages with zero relevance to BS, so my hunch is that this is a Thunderbird directory database glitch, but I only have &lt;50% confidence in the usefulness of that hunch.  </li></ul> <p><br> | Please give complete details of at least one of the filter rules  </p><p>Keeping in mind that the rogue Folder BS continues to absorb messages without my active approval since the last version of Filter BS was deleted sometime after 11/14/25, those filters would have had rules along these lines: </p><p>√ Match any of the following &lt;From, To, Cc or Bcc&gt; contains bs &lt;Subject&gt; contains bs </p><p>Perform these actions: Move Message to &lt;Folder BS&gt; (which is a server-based folder 2 levels below the inbox, with 2 levels of sub-folders within it for annual and monthly filing.) </p><p><br> Also keep in mind that I've searched all the filters for the actual text BS stands for and found no other matches since deleting Filter BS. (That said, I'm not clear that the search function in the Message Filters window searches anything other than the names of the filters...) </p><p><br> I just examined the Filter log, which spans 6/9/25 through today, 1/16/26. The results show that: • ""Filter*BS"" ran 41 times between 6/16/25 and 10/8/25 I identified enough incorrectly filed messages in Folder BS during that time period to know that I would have been so frustrated with the problem that I apparently deleted that filter and created a new version, with slightly different actions required (no tagging or priority change, just moving the message to Folder BS). • ""Filter BS"" ran 38 times between 10/17/25 and 11/14/25 Once again, I identified enough incorrectly filed messages in Folder BS during that time period to know that I still hadn't solved the problem by deleting and replacing the filter. And once again, I deleted the filter in frustration, and did not replace it. • Entries including the path to Folder BS appear only 79 times between 6/16/25 and 11/14/25, but there are more than 171 messages in Folder BS between those dates - about double what should be there. • Messages inappropriately filed in Folder BS were received as recently as yesterday, despite the continuing fact that There. Is. No. Filter. Set. To. Perform. That. Move. </p><p>I hope that provides some clarity... many thanks for any thoughts you can offer. </p><p>John </p>",jfmarketinfo,false,0,0

If I select a cell in a table, right-click, and choose the Select All item in the pop up menu I can then copy and paste the whole table. Slightly weird operability but it works. Strangely, the border colour is not copied across. </blockquote> <p>I went to the trouble of looking at tables copied from Excel at one point as most of the formatting did not arrive in Thunderbird.  I though that was a poor showing of what you see is what you get.  What I found was Excel only put the basic table and data on the clipboard as HTML it put everything on the clipboard in RTF.  Thunderbird defaults to picking plain text or HTML.  I would not put it past Thunderbird to also leave out the styling.   Personally I do not use grids in emails unless I am desperate as they generally present particularly poorly on phone screens.  Lots and lots of left and right scrolling as the screen is so much smaller that the desktop. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I do have three email recipients who use crappy email clients that don't show HTML quotations properly.

Instead of setting up a table from scratch for each quotation I want to keep a table in my templates folder and just paste it into the emails I'm writing.

Google are offering ALL new  mail to the pop client,  not just the inbox part because all of the new mail has arrived in the maildrop.  </p> <em><p>Groggo <a href=""#answer-1794576"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a></p></em> <blockquote>No, what's happening is Gmail is moving the phish to spam, but Tbird is downloading it anyway.  Can you set Tbird to just download what is in the Inbox? </blockquote> <p>No you can not.   POP has no concept of an inbox even, let alone phishing or spam folders  it has a maildrop where all mail received for the address is to be found.  Some providers do not follow the standard and hive off spam from what is offered for download in POP.  I spent time with a very frustrated individual yesterday because their provider did not offer spam so they were forever messing around in webmail to get false positives into their mail client by marking mail as not spam.  For him IMAP was really the only choice as that downloaded all the server side folders,  but it would have been a far superior solution if the provider had just offer the maildrop content without imposing their own non standard take on email.  If you are curious that provider was ""the messaging company""  they might meet your wants better than Google who are apparently following the standard. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

IF those messages are in your new POP account, try this:  - with the Importexporttools NG addon installed, highlight Local Folders, rightclick, and select the importexport option to import mbox, and select the input file in the old profile (IGNORE the msf entry). Now, open the folder, select all messages and COPY (not move) to the POP account's inbox. then repeat for the sent folder. then delete the two folders you created in Local Folders. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

I use a number of email addresses depending on whether business, personal or other. I fill in the correct from address if it is wrong.

Going backwards sometimes works, but only with compatibility.ini file deleted. Thunderbird's rejection of current profile doesn't mean a problem; it just sometimes starts fresh. That can be frustrating because it leaves user wondering about lost messages and contact list. My preference is to restore the old profile, after first verifying that it is complete. That eliminates the issue of missing folders. Copying mbox files always works, but can be messy with POP accounts, as it can impact the 'last message downloaded' status. </p>",davidsk,false,0,0

Now about halfway in to the second day, it was down to about 100 MB.  Does this behavior sound like what you'd expect? </p>",jkerman,false,0,0

How can I tell if Thunderbird is just never going to come back?? </blockquote> <p>Yes, that is correct. This approach avoids copying or moving messages among server folders, which takes much time and, some people have said, may be prone to errors. </p><p>First, make a back-up copy of your profile. </p><p>Then make sure that all the messages that you want to copy or move are downloaded from the server. I believe that the way to do that is to go into properties of the source folder (right click on the folder and select ""Properties""), then click on the ""Synchronization"" tab, make sure that the the folder is selected for offline use and press ""download now"". If all your messages were not already on your computer, they should be soon. </p><p>Then create a local folder. </p><p>Now I would go offline so no new messages arrive during this process. Select all the messages in the source folder. Right click on them and select ""copy"" them (not move, in case something goes wrong) to the local folder. They should all be copied fairly quickly. I just copied 2,000 messages in a few seconds. You can tell when the process is done by comparing message counts in the source and destination folders. You can also see entries in the Activity Manager (Tools menu) and maybe progress in the status bar at the bottom of Thunderbird's window. </p><p>Now you can go back online and delete the messages in source folder. If you use the standard delete function, they will still have to be moved to the trash, so there will be a long move between server folders anyway, which you wanted to avoid. But you could use shift-delete to delete them immediately instead of putting them in the trash folder. That should avoid moves between server folders. </p><p>All this is describing what you could have done with your inbox and what you could do with Inbox 2025 now. I am not responding to your initial query. For the problems of Thunderbird crashing and not getting new messages, I would try the standard troubleshooting method: start Windows in safe mode with networking, then start Thunderbird in troubleshooting mode (help menu) and see if the problems persist.

I don't see anything that I would suggest changing, partly because I am not familiar with gmail, which I don't use. But I wonder why you use port 465 on one outgoing server and port 587 (which, I believe is more standard) on the other. I also wonder whether you should have two outgoing servers or if your two gmail accounts should use the same outgoing server. These are things that I wonder. I do not know the answers. </p><p>Your photos remind me that your ""old"" gmail account uses a custom domain. I am no expert on DNS records used for e-mail (though I have my own domain and have had to mess with DNS records a few times in the last 25 years), but I read that it's possible to use DNS records to forward e-mail messages to a specific address. Is it possible that you are doing that? I don't know if a failure from that process would cause a Google server to give you an error message. </p><p>So I am grasping at straws, whatever that means, but maybe the idea of DNS records provokes a useful memory or thought in your brain. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

I have changed server settings to longer intervals for the accounts that receive less urgent emails and will see if that makes a difference.

As I said, perhaps only annoying and not a critical issue. </p>",sage7,false,0,0

Other accounts (server accounts, e.g., gmail) store messages both on a server and on the computer. IMAP keeps them in sync. You want 1) to ensure that all the messages in your server account are downloaded from the server to the computer, then 2) copy them to folders in the local folders account. Then those messages wil be on the computer no matter what happens to the server account (gmail). </p><p>To do 1, which you asked about: Go to account settings &gt; synchronization &amp; storage and check ""Keep messages in all folders for this account..."" Then click ""Advanced"" and select all folders. I don't know if that second step is redundant. </p><p>This next step may also be redundant, but I would check the settings just to be sure: For each folder with messages that you want to preserve, right click on the folder, select ""Properties"", go to the ""General information"" tab and check ""when getting messages for this account ..."", then to go the ""Synchronization"" tab, and check ""Select this folder for offline use"", then ""download now"". </p><p>To do 2: After that, copying folders from a server account to the local folders account is easy. All the folders that you want can even be copied in one step. You can shift-click or control-click or command-click to select multilple folders. Then right click on them, select ""copy to"", and copy them to the local folders account. Copying is quick. I tested this process earlier today and copied 2,000 messages in a few seconds. </p><p>You should back up your profile before you do anything and after you do everything. </p><p>If you copy folders now while the gmail account is still active, you will have to decide what to do about new messages arriving in your gmail account that are not in your local folders. One approach would be to create a message filter to copy them automatically to a local folder. Then your local folders will be current at all times. Oh, you would also have to create a filter to copy sent messages. Or you could wait until right before the gmail account is disabled before copying your folders to the local folders account. </p><p>Allmail: you may know that it holds all messages, including those in trash. Your messages have other gmail labels that show up in Thunderbird as folders. If you subscribe to allmail, you will have duplicates of all your messages. A common recommendation ion the forum is not to subscribe to allmail in Thunderbird because of the duplicates. </p><p>I don't use gmail and I am not an expert on it, but I believe that those statements are true and helpful. </p><p>Keep asking. </p>",mozilla98,false,0,0

So I'm only addressing that part of the issue first. Sorry for the verbose bit that follows&nbsp;:) </p><p>Gmail stores all is emails in the 'All Mail' folder. Gmail understands this is not good for organising or locating emails, so they invented 'Labels'.  That means the 'Label' is like a tag put on the email stored in 'All Mail'. That email can now display a virtual view in any Label (aka folder in Thunderbird) mentioned against that email in 'All Mail'. Although in Thunderbird, it's a real copy because Thunderbird does not use labels like gmail. </p><p>If you delete an email from eg: 'gAMES', you are sending a message to gmail to delete that email. Gmail puts it in server Trash - removes all labels from email and then deletes it from the 'All Mail' folder. That means it's no longer displays in both labels - gAMES and Games. As imap folders synchronise with server folder/label to show what is on server, they simultaneously stop showing same email. The 'All MAil' folder also gets updated to remove the deleted email. So no matter how many copies you have - they all disappear at once because you sent the instruction to delete the email in 'All Mail'. </p><p><strong>So, I hear you ask, how do I only delete an email from gAMES but not from Games&nbsp;?</strong> You have to use the following technique.  </p> <ul><li> select email and hold down 'Shift' key whilst pressing on 'del' key. </li></ul> <p>This has the effect of deleting and by-passing the Trash. Beware there is no 'Undo' for this. What does it do? From your point of view, it removes the email only from the gAMES folder. From Gmail point of view - you sent instruction to remove the 'gAMES' label from that email stored in 'All Mail'. So email still exists in 'All Mail' with the 'Games' label meaning it still displays in the Games label/folder. </p>",Toad-Hall,false,0,0

However, as you also subscribe to see the 'All Mail' folder, that folder contains a copy of every email - incoming and outgoing and archived (stored in All Mail with no labels) - the lot. So your gmail account already has a double of everything.  </p><p>I tend to advise people not to subscribe to the 'All MAil' folder because if you delete anything from that 'All Mail' folder you will be deleting that email from any other folder it resides in. Also, if your Anti-Virus product is allowed to scan folders and it attempts to fix something in that 'All Mail' folder, you stand a good chance of losing all your emails.  It's adviseable to not allow any scanning of your Thunderbird profile because even if it finds something, you do not want it trying to fix anything.

Rather thoroughly. </p><p>BECAUSE TB makes mistakes, and a deleted mistake CANNOT be recovered, is precisely why I don't allow TB's automatic filtering to delete *anything*. </p><p>But I have my own list. And if you (not you personally, but I'm sure you understand what I mean) are on it, I don't, without any exception, want to see or recover your mail.  Particularly, I don't want to see it in Trash, as one of so many potential spam messages (maybe 100 at a time) that the volume requires me to painstakingly go through the entire list to see if a mistake has been made. </p><p>If TB would filter MY list first, and DELETE anything in that list, immediately, those deletions would NEVER have mistakes. Because they would be on my KNOWN spam list. But it does not. It puts them in Trash, with, on rare occasion, a mistake. </p><p>I want TB to filter MY LIST as mail arrives, and delete ONLY what I specify. But DELETE those, not move them to trash. My filter would catch about 95%+ of all the spam. It would not make mistakes. So instead of having to sort through, say, 100 mails in the Trash to look for TB mistakes, I would have to sort through maybe 5. Clearly, this would be an enormous improvement. </p><p>No, I'm not, of course, going to let TB delete anything based on it's OWN rules.

So I routinely get the same spam from the same places, but in high volume. (Changing my email is not a good option at all.)  </p><p>But I can (and actually have made) filter those repeat messages. I just can't get TB to get them out of the way as they come in, which should not be a problem. Remember, these are MY rules, not TB's ""learning function"". These are KNOWN, and known-to-be, 100% garbage. </p><p>And I don't want to sort through them to ensure that a rare TB auto-filtering mistake has occurred. There are emails I know, from NAMES (the spammers have defeated address filtering for the most part via random character generation that precedes a valid domain that one DARE NOT list). If that NAME is in the From, it's garbage. I don't want to see it. Not ever. There should be an incoming filter that deletes those. </p><p>The other suggestion, was probably unnecessary. But I will eventually have to leave TB if I cannot get SPECIFIC deletion (according to MY rules, and NEVER delete according to TB's adaptive system—because as we know, the adaptive system makes mistakes).

I used a variety of search terms, but found enough information to make progress. </p><p>The general process I followed: (these steps are [mostly] all on gmail) (general process - not detailed step by step instructions) - Make sure that special gmail folders are not being synchronized- All Mail especially, then Purchases, Social, Updates, and etc. (These seem to be additional gmail labels, and would result in Tbird downloading them multiple times.) </p><pre>-- Gmail | Settings | Labels | Show in IMAP -- Thunderbird | Account Settings | Synchronization &amp; Storage --- CHECK Keep messages in all folders on this computer --- Advanced ... Tick or Clear each folder </pre> <p>- (I downloaded thousands of duplicates before I learned what was happening.) - Manually, on Gmail, verify that ALL messages are in some folder. That is, no unlabeled messages. This was a bit time consuming, because I didn't realize all the ways gmail was doing things under the covers that were breaking what I was trying to do. For instance: the search command [ has:nouserlabels ] was failing because of messages that gmail added special labels to. </p><p>Also, in conversation view (which I use), a labelled thread can have unlabelled messages. The simplest way I found to fix this was to create a dummy label (I used ,aaa) then: 1. select ALL messages in one label (myLabel) and add label ,aaa 2. select ALL messages in ,aaa and under the Labels button, CLEAR the ,aaa checkbox and SET the tri-state checkbox for (myLabel). This will add the label to any unlabeled messages. 3. Repeat for all your labels. </p><p>I ran into trouble because I got impatient and didn't wait for gmail to finish executing the command before starting the next step. With tens of thousands of messages in some labels the process took some time. </p><p>Because I'm not syncing All Mail it's necessary to assign a label to every message that I want to preserve. For has:nouserlabels to correctly find all the messages I wanted, I had to remove all the special gmail labels. (If you organize your mail by folders (gmail labels) All Mail will be everything in one big pile - no labels.) </p><p>4. Make certain that Tbird has downloaded ALL your messages, not just headings. </p><p>5. Close Tbird. Using your OS file manager, COPY (don't move) the <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> [ default name for only one gmail account ] folder from Your profile's ImapMail folder to your profile's Mail/Local Folders folder. When you re-start Tbird it will find your duplicated structure under Local Folders. </p><p>6. After verifying that everything is in your local folders, you can use either Tbird or gmail to delete whatever you want. </p><p>Note: Even after compacting all folders, the IMAP created mbox files can be dramatically larger than a new mbox folder that you copy messages into. For instance: using ImportExportTools NG Search and Export Messages to export all messages from a large IMAP mbox to a new mbox file I saw a compacted mbox drop from 2.6GB to 1.3GB. I'm still in the process of verifying, but it appears that all the messages and attachments are in the copy. </p><p>So - moving messages from gmail (any IMAP provider, actually) to local storage is possible.  Is there a magic tool available? Not that I have found. </p><p>The time consuming piece for me was learning all the ways I didn't fully understand what gmail and Tbird were doing. Once Tbird had fully downloaded all the messages, creating the local copies was fast - simply an OS file manager copy. [ Shrinking the final mbox sizes adds time but is an optional step. As far as I know, the only tradeoff is disk storage space (vs) the time to export messages one folder at a time. ] </p><p>Now, the housekeeping for freeing up space on gmail --- I used the gmail web interface; I believe using Tbird's search and selection and bulk deletion would have worked as well. Which way has more (network traffic) overhead? I have no idea. So: use the tools (gmail or Tbird) that are most comfortable for you. </p><p>(It took me about 2 1/2 days to figure this out and transfer something like 80,000 messages.) </p>",clifmks,false,0,0

Fortunately Thunderbird is built on the same foundation as Firefox, so like a chameleon when required it can run with the need to be a browser and display browser pages,  which it does for the google oauth authentication flow. </p><p>For the Authentication process to work,  you must have cookies enabled in Thunderbird (yes it is a thing and is enabled by default)  the process also requires JavaScript to be enabled in Thunderbird.  This is all discussed here  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-conversion-google-mail-accounts-oauth20"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatic-conversion-google-mail-accounts-oauth20</a> </p><p>When you use oAuth authentication Thunderbird never actually knows your password,  nor does it know the two factor authentication key that you may also be asked to insert that was texted or email to you.  Those pages are webpages served by Google and the posted responses go back to them. Only at the end does Thunderbird get a token from google which it uses to authenticate going forward.  While the token is stored in Thunderbird password manager,  you will never be asked for it.  This is an entirely automated process and storing the token in an encrypted form as if it was a passord lread to it being stored as one. </p><p>Most folk have issues with Gmail authentication because of their choices regarding passwords and security software.  The use of VPNs is becoming widespread,  but nothing is more likely to see your authentication with gmail requiring a reset that the VPN.  At a very simple level Google know where you phone is (I am sure their hacking detection algorithm is actually very complex, not simple.  But for this discussion simple will suffice).  Then you start connecting Thunderbird from somewhere else entirely.  That raises a red flag about you being hacked, your token is revoked and Thunderbird asks for a re-authentication. </p><p>Changing you password in Google should not affect Thunderbird as it is not using your google password.  Google might ask for a re-authentication by revoking Thunderbird token,  but there should be nothing inherently tricky about it.  Unless you have an antivirus that is blocking aspects of the process.  Unfortunately the only windows antivirus I am aware of that is not subject to regular issue is Microsoft/Windows  Defender. </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

Diese wurde dann gespeichert und beeinflusste, was passiert, wenn man „Alle Konten abrufen“ oder Shift + F5 verwendete. </p><p>🔹 Was sich geändert hat </p><p>In neueren Versionen (ab etwa Thunderbird 102.x und später, darunter auch die 140er oder 147): </p><p>Diese Checkbox taucht zwar noch im Dialog auf, </p><p>aber der gesetzte Zustand wird in vielen Fällen nicht mehr gespeichert oder wirkt nicht mehr, wie Nutzerberichte zeigen. </p><p>Das war ein wiederholt diskutiertes Problem – bei manchen Nutzern funktionierte das Setzen des Hakens nur manchmal oder gar nicht mehr. In einem der Berichte heißt es, dass der Haken in neueren Versionen nach Verlassen des Einstellungsdialogs wieder verschwindet und wohl als Bug wahrgenommen wird. </p><p>🔹 Welche Version war „noch gut“? </p><p>Es gibt keine offiziell dokumentierte Versionsnummer, bei der diese Funktion zuverlässig funktionierte und nach der sie plötzlich entfernt wurde – aber aus den Nutzerberichten ergibt sich Folgendes: </p><p>✅ Thunderbird 102.x und früher → Diese Checkbox funktionierte im Allgemeinen noch so, wie man es erwarten würde. </p><p>⚠️ Ab Thunderbird 102.4.x und später (einschließlich 115, 140, 147) → Die Checkbox ist sichtbar, wird aber oft nicht gespeichert oder wirkt nicht zuverlässig. </p><p>Das deutet darauf hin, dass die Funktion mit den größeren UI- und Backend-Updates um 102 herum nicht mehr zuverlässig unterstützt wird, auch wenn sie noch sichtbar ist. </p>",itm8b,false,0,0

That is because the thunderbird startup profile expects the same name as the last time. Just leave alone. The best you can do is to not have an unworkable system.

Hey, Rick, According to Toad Hall, there is a way to tell how the email got marked junk even after it lands in Thunderbird. This contradicts your assertion quoted above. I am delighted with this new bit of info and now plan to try it out. A message I sent to myself landed in junk.

Thunderbird will ask you for a password if it needs one and offer to save it.   </p><p>However just setting the authentication method to password does not guarantee you will be asked if you have other software on your system that consumes the connection attempt so the server never requests a password. Common causes of failures to request passwords are things like antivirus products and in your case they are also blocking access to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost"" rel=""nofollow"">localhost </a> and the odd proxy type port numbers that Proton uses. </p><p>Port 1143 appears to be registered for use by informix to exchange data.

See <a href=""https://www.pentestpad.com/port-exploit/port-1025-microsoft-rpc-microsoft-remote-procedure-call"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pentestpad.com/port-exploit/port-1025-microsoft-rpc-microsoft-remote-procedure-call</a> </p> <blockquote> I have two gmail accounts which are working but I also have a Protonmail account which has stopped working.

Always have.  Thunderbird does ask you to enter it when you are first creating an account,  simply to reduce the number of password requests as there may be many attempts to connect to the mail server in the setup process attempting to detect the servers settings. </p> <blockquote> How do I do this and where in the docs is this described, please  Thanks </blockquote> <p>As you appear to be using Linux in one of the X11 version I will guess it is probably a Ubuntu derived distribution and will be using SNAP packages with their special sandbox built in.  How that works with  those ports,  I have no idea.  But many folk have issues with the SNAP versions and permissions and have reverted to DEB packages which just work. </p><p>Ubuntu derived distributions will also most likely have the Ports 1025 and 1143 closed. While the definition of localhost says that the transmission should never go to a physical adaptor,  I could see it being bundled with the general software firewall rules.  So have you checked your software firewall?  Have you checked your installed version of Thunderbird has access to those ports through the snap sandbox.  </p><p>Do you have development environments or server software like Apache installed that may by consuming port 1025 connections or even things like mailpit or mailcatcher? </p>",MattAuSupport,false,0,0

I never would have guessed that the File menu would be acting as a contextual menu, as this does not conform to any UI standard.  I don't know of any other program that uses the File menu as a contextual menu like this.  This is horrible user interface design.  The right-click contextual menu provides no option to export the private key.  Instead, the right-click contextual menu has been broken into two parts, with the part of the right-click contextual menu that should allow exporting the private key actually appearing in the File menu instead.  It's amazing that a user interface with so many users can be so poorly implemented.  Just amazing. </p>",antifascist,false,0,0

Moreover, Thunderbird is a local email application, meaning it installs and runs as a client on your device. It does not provide email addresses, nor the service to transmit emails. But Thunderbird can be used with your existing email address and service provider to send, receive, sort and search your email messages. </p><p>Wrt your concern about Gmail and AI, this is completely unrelated to the email client you use to access your Gmail account. It is of course up to you not to use Gmail as your email provider if you feel uncomfortable about what they are doing.  For standard, free users, Google maintains that they do not train Gemini or other large language models on your email content. Features like Smart Compose or Automatic Tab Sorting do ""read"" your emails to work, but Google clarified that these are localized processes. Turning them on does not grant Google the right to use your emails for AI training. If you explicitly use Gemini Extensions (where you ask the AI to ""find the receipt in my Gmail""), the specific prompts you type and the resulting interactions may be used to improve the service, but the rest of your inbox remains private. </p><p>Note, every email provider is scanning your messages for malware, a.k.a. they are all 'reading' your email anyway. </p>",christ1,false,0,0

If the messages that you didn't want to be filter are be handled properly, that confirms that there is a problem in the filter somewhere.  The other option is to post screenshots of all filters, including details on the email addresses that are going wrong and to which folder.

Having followed your instructions, I think I have retrieved all the folders and subfolders. They are all now in Local Folders. Not sure that all the emails are there, but I will have to trust that they are. I cannot thank you enough as I was getting in a panic about it. However, all is not quite sorted yet without a bit more help. Because, before I asked my original question, I had asked a local IT chap who knows about Macs to have a go at retrieval. Turns out he didn't know about Thunderbird, although he did get his head around it, sort of.  He decided to add another account, a duplicate of my gmail account but as IMAP. The original gmail account is POP. He then made the IMAP account download everything. It was very slow and limited to a certain amount of data per 24hrs.  While this was happening, I asked my original question on this forum, which you have solved for me. But I have now ended up with a mess, and many duplicated folders, many of which are not complete, do not have all/any of the emails or the subfolders. I think the best way to show you is for me to do some screenshots.  So there are 5, in sequence, showing the whole left-hand column in TB from top to bottom , with a small amount of overlap for continuity. If you have the time to look at this you will see what a mess and how much duplication there is. If for example, you look at all the Inboxes, you will see that each one has a different number of unread files, which implies to me that not all emails are in all the inboxes, ie the inboxes are not all identical. </p><pre>So I need to be able to compare them, side by side on the same screen, to cross check. I hope you understand. So, my question is, what can I do about this other than to compare one folder with the same one froma different bit of the tree? I can get two TB folders to open together in two adjacent windows, and make comparisons, and then am I right that if I delete from one side the other side will not be changed? not be deleted? </pre> <p>Is there a better way to do this?  Eventually, when I get rid of the duplication I want to also remove one of the gmail accounts, as they are the same email address and all incoming emails go to both. So is it better to try to preserve the original POP account, or go with the IMAP one? I think I have to make this decision before starting to remove duplicates. I confess I don't know what the difference is and which is better. (I have an iPhone and gmail works well on that with the app and through Apple Mail). </p><p>I'm sorry this is such a marathon post......  Thankyou if you're prepared to go on helping me. I'll attach the screenshots now. </p>",ruthnichollsphotos,false,0,0

I will ignore your vulgarity and attempt to give a useful response. To be clear, you are NOT clear in explaining your issue. Is this same email being returned to the inbox, or is more email coming to you from the same sender?

Translation for you: thunderbird does not have a black list; just because you mark a message as spam does not guarantee that future messages will be marked as spam. If you want thunderbird to be more active, you have an obligation, also documented, to train thunderbird by identifying regularly both spam and non-spam. With that, I end my response.

I have been working on this for about a week  I was unable to send emails with my spectrum account because of a timing out issue.  I have been reading various ways to try to fix it and somehow I wound up with the illustrated stuck on the email page in Thunderbird.  (I can send emails from the Spectrum site.)  I tried to delete it but can't and it locked up my account.  I wound up deleting Thunderbird and reinstalling it but it is still there.  (I also tried Betterbird and it was there too.)  My guess is I messed up my profile some how.  I still get incoming emails but I can't send the above or delete the page.  (It doesn't affect my gmail.) I am sorry about not doing a better explanation.  I am obviously not a computer wiz.   I know you are a regular helper (I have seen your answers) so what we think is a major problem may have an obvious solution to you.  I don't like to mess around with things because I am always afraid something like this will happen and make it worse. I have been using Thunderbird for years and I am used to the setup and like it.

But I have now ended up with a mess, and many duplicated folders, many of which are not complete, do not have all/any of the emails or the subfolders.

So there are 5, in sequence, showing the whole left-hand column in TB from top to bottom , with a small amount of overlap for continuity. If you have the time to look at this you will see what a mess and how much duplication there is. </blockquote> <p>Undeniably this is a big mess but actually you are the only person to sort out this mess since you have created all those thematic ""archive"" folders in Local Folders. You know what they contain and where they belong in the folder hierarchy.

And you can copy selected messages from one folder to the other (see image). I'd prefer ""copy"" to ""move"" to avoid moving to wrong folders and then missing them in the original folder.

I confess I don't know what the difference is and which is better. (I have an iPhone and gmail works well on that with the app and through Apple Mail). </blockquote> <p>Difficult question. Some people get better along with POP accounts than with IMAP, often because they began emailing with with POP accounts. Eventually, when both your gmail POP account and your gmail IMAP account have the same folders with the same messages contents, you could delete one of them. But since you also use this gmail address on your iPhone with Apple Mail it might be better to keep the IMAP account in Thunderbird in order to synchronise messages between Thunderbird and iPhone. </p>",Mapenzi,false,0,0
