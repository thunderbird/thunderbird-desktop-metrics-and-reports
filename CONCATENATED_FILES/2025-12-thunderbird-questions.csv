However, that is just the latest of TB behaving bizarrely over the last few days: filters not working, TB repeatedly re-downloading whole folders and now this is the last straw.  Same sort of short pause then total lockup in troubleshoot mode too.   </p><p>I have to have an Emailer I am not constantly fighting and debugging.  My sense now is that the main database structures of my TB have somehow been corrupted.  </p><p>I think this may go back to [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1541906|https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1541906"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1541906</a>].  That problem transferred to a different folder when I changed my filter to redirect the routine messages to that different filter so it wasn't the folder, I didn't have time to sleuth it further and as it only affected those messages, which were not important, I ignored it and TB worked fine for other things.  Then it even stopped happening with new ones of those messages but still if I opened one of the old ones, TB would lock.  Again, I didn't really need the old ones so I ignored this.  </p><p>Disconcertingly, Firefox, my main browser, has today become afflicted with something similar: launches, OK for about a minute, then locks, no different in troubleshoot.  I will report that and come back and add the link here but perhaps some mix of Mozilla and KDE and or Ubuntu recent changes are behind this but the TB problem above was there on Ubuntu and has been brewing all week so a shared Firefox/TB issue is not the whole story. </p><p>I am not sure how much longer I can persist with TB given the frequency with which I have had really nasty problems with it in recent years.  However, I feel a loyalty (I am a financial contributor) and I know that rebuilding my filters in another Emailer will take probably a full day (and I don't know what I'd swap to, using Kmail/Kontact for now so I'm not Emailless).  So I would like to have one last go and my wish is to create a clean install and then I hope, rescue my address books and filters from the dying version and see if one last go can resuscitate things.  So my questions, as I think the correct answers to this have varied a lot over recent years.  I would like answers known to work for TB is 140.5.0esr (64 bit) on Kubuntu 25.10 if possible but Ubuntu 25.10 is obviously close. </p> <ul><li> How do I best save and transfer the address books? </li><li> Ditto all my filters (a lot!) </li></ul> <p>TIA, Chris </p>",ce_mozilla;wsmwk;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/142.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",3,0,0,,,

Dopo diverse lamentele ho dapprima cercato di bloccare l'inoltro poi, visto che non ci riuscivo, ho proprio rimosso l'add on (non ricordo il nome), sperando che così finisse l'inconveniente. L'ho cancellato da oltre 10 giorni, ma l'amministrazione continua a ricevere numerosissimi inoltri, per cui si sono fortemente lamentati con me. Non so più cosa fare, se non riuscirete a darmi un consiglio efficace con mio immenso dispiacere sarò costretto ad eliminare Thunderbird dal mio pc, sperando che così il problema si risolva. Confidando con tutto il cuore che riuscirete a risolvermi il problema, vi auguro una buona giornata. giorgio riela </p>",grg0401;@next;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:145.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/145.0,3,0,0,,,

This morning the Customized Menu Bar in my T-Bird was there, as confirmed by my wife... and then it wasn't.  No idea what happened. I spent a long while poking around to try to find what had been inadvertently changed, and came up empty. So, went in to Customize Toolbars and rebuilt the Mail toolbar as I recalled its layout, as we use it a lot every day. Now it seems to be fine. T-Bird is kinda like Windows, where there's more than one way to do something, and sometimes several paths to the same function. I know there are new Keys, or whatever they're called, that replace or replicate the old Customized Menu Bar. But we have been using T-Bird for ages, and though I've noted all the updates and improvements over the years, we are pretty comfortable with the basics that we use, and have not made many changes. So, we're OK. Just thought it was weird what happened. Thanks for being there.

La mia casella è ospitata su Aruba, ma utilizzo Thunderbird per la gestione quotidiana della posta. Ho già contattato l’assistenza Aruba, che dopo le loro verifiche mi ha confermato che lato server non risultano anomalie e mi ha quindi suggerito di rivolgermi a voi per ulteriori accertamenti. Il problema che riscontro è il seguente: da questa estate, in modo irregolare e non prevedibile, alcune email che invio da Thunderbird sembrano partire correttamente in quel momento, ma poi non arrivano ai destinatari. Inoltre non compaiono nemmeno nella mia cartella “Posta inviata”, né risultano in altre cartelle (posta in uscita, posta eliminata, ecc.). È come se alcune email, sporadicamente, si “perdessero” dopo l’invio. La maggior parte dei messaggi viene inviata senza problemi, ma in alcuni giorni può capitare che più email consecutive non vengano recapitare e non risultino più tracciabili: ad esempio, questa estate ho avuto un episodio in cui 5–6 email inviate nello stesso giorno non sono mai arrivate e non sono presenti nella posta inviata. Per cercare di monitorare la situazione avevo creato una cartella dedicata e inserito il mio indirizzo in copia nascosta, così da verificare la corretta consegna, ma non posso controllare ogni messaggio manualmente. Inoltre, anche con questo metodo, recentemente è ricapitato che una mia email non risultasse essere stata inviata né ricevuta. A questo punto avrei bisogno del vostro supporto per capire: se si tratta di un problema noto o già segnalato da altri utenti; se ci sono impostazioni o configurazioni in Thunderbird che potrei modificare per evitare che le email “scompaiano”; se esiste un metodo di diagnostica o log che potrei attivare per aiutarvi a identificare la causa. Il problema è purtroppo sporadico, ma impatta la mia operatività, poiché non posso ogni volta controllare manualmente se ogni email è stata effettivamente inviata. Vi ringrazio in anticipo per l’attenzione e per qualsiasi indicazione possiate darmi. </p>",giulia5;@next;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/142.0.0.0 Safari/537.36;kb_visits_prior:[""/it/kb/profili-thunderbird""]",1,0,0,,,

The teams option works fine for 4 of them and is quite usable for chat but one of them responds that the browser is an unsupported version. I use Ubuntu 24.04 and have thunderbird and firefox installed from deb files (and the repos) so both are the current/release versions and overall everything works well so I don't believe there is a systemic issue.  All connections to the clients' exchange systems are through the owl plugin. With the one client, as soon as you try to connect to their teams site, the 'Hmmm, your browser isn't supported' page comes up. As I manage that client's office platform, I know I've not made any changes to the back-end settings nor have I done so or had to do so on any of my other clients platforms so I don't think there is anything unusual about the Office 365 side (but am willing to be proved wrong). If I try logging in to the problematic teams site using firefox it works perfectly so I don't believe it is firefox being an issue. I have deleted and re-added the account.

The customer is an ex computer science professor and is going blind, so a lot of his relevant information is organized within these folders. Key issues that have made this different from a typical install: -Profile &amp; Local folders are stored in his old OS drive (that is now D:) D:/~/user/appdata/roaming/Thunderbird/~ -files are more than 2GB, so I'm unable to export as .zip -His folders are alphabetical, and every time stops at a particularly larger folder that starts with a D (which had considerably more folders than many others) </p><p>The only solution I have come up with is copying/uploading the local folders to his IMAP email, but not all emails are being uploaded either.

This has been intentionally set to “Split addresses” mode, where (according to Proton) I can “Setup multiple email addresses individually”, and I have also disabled “Show all mail”. </li><li> I have set up a new Thunderbird account for each Proton Mail address. </li></ul> <p>After only a couple of days of migrating my Outlook messages over to Thunderbird (in Proton Mail), two items of concern became apparent – this query here is the much more important issue; I’ll raise another question here on the community for the other problem. </p><p>Now I understand that all of the folders imported or created in Proton Mail have no association with mail addresses.  I also expect – but please tell me if I’m wrong – that on the basis of Thunderbird being configured to “Subscribe” to all folders, as well as having the server setting of “Show only subscribed folders” <em>unchecked</em> for each account, then I should see all messages in all folders across all accounts. </p><p>I’ve only just started the migration, but even now I’ve imported ~7,000 messages and – based upon the presumption that all accounts <em>should</em> see all folders and their messages – it appears to be a very inconsistent (and worrying!) picture (see attachment). </p><p>So far, I’ve: </p> <ul><li> Resynced the Proton Mail Bridge.  And resynced it again.  And again! </li><li> I’ve even run a repair on the Proton Mail Bridge. </li><li> Before any of the two steps above began, I deleted the accounts and data from Thunderbird.  When Proton Mail Bridge has then finally resynced, I added the accounts back in again. </li><li> I’ve even gone as far as deleting my Thunderbird profile to effectively start it all again. </li></ul> <p>And finally, on a second machine (Dell laptop, same config as desktop above), I installed the same three apps and then added only <em>one</em> account to Thunderbird, which returned me just the one single message in the Inbox - absolutely nothing in any of the folders. </p><p>The Proton Mail app does show all messages in all of the correct folders, so could this be a Thunderbird issue, a Proton Mail Bridge issue, a combination, or something completely different. </p><p>As I said at the beginning, any and all constructive and helpful feedback will be most gratefully received. </p>",TechD;MattAuSupport;mozilla98;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0,5,0,0,,,

Trouble is this ISN'T being persisted, when I open a different folder I have to go through this process again in order to access my emails in that folder. </p><p>Me thinks you got a bug in your software Kemosabe! </p>",eveningdarkstar;MattAuSupport;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:140.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/140.0,4,0,0,,,

The message filters take my POP mail and sort it into the inbox folders, delete the mail I don't want and even remove the entries from my POP server to keep things tidy.  The filters work perfectly and some filters have more than 100 entries into a single filter!  I have several hundred hours in this filtering and , as I said, the filtering is perfect.  Now for my problem.  I can go into ""Message Filters"" and use the search to locate the message filter I am attempting to edit.  However, once inside the message filter, I cannot search for any entry that I have added to that filter.  Sometimes, the filter may have 50-60 entries in it and it would be handy to be able to sort for the entry I need.  Please understand that the message filter entries are applied in order (from top to bottom) and so, sorting the entries alphabetically would ruin the filter.    I would like to know how to search ALL of the message filters for any entry inside the filter.   It would be VERY HANDY if I could simply go to ""Message Filters"" and perform a search that would list not only the FILTER the entry was in but all occurrences of the search term as both a FILTER and an ENTRY TO THE FILTER. That is the way the email search works.  If you search for any word in the search, it tells you every occurrence of the email and any occurrence of that search term inside any email.  Can we make the search of message filters work the same way?   Or, if it works this way, can you tell me how to use the search to find an entry WITHIN a message filter?

I'm hoping for some advice as to how to trace the path. One possibility is that there is a location on my server that is used to connect to the certs and this is holding stale information due to the recent restore done for the remote server. Another is that maybe there is cached information or something else blocking the request from Thunderbird. </p><p>From Thunderbird, I am presented with a form ""Add Security Exception"". This indicates that thunderbird is contacting the location <a href=""http://adonax.com:993"" rel=""nofollow"">adonax.com:993</a>. I checked the port from the server using UFW and it is open to all. The Thunderbird form however hangs when I hit the ""Get Certificate"" button, and clicking the ""Confirm Security Exception"" appears to do nothing. The button ""View..."" opens a tab with the expired certificate. All the information on the certificate that is displayed by Thunderbird looks good, matches what I have in terms of URLs, but the dates are wrong. </p><p>Is there perhaps something blocking thunderbird from using port 993? Is there a way to test that? If 993 is working, I will try to research what is going on there at the Ubuntu end.

Me and my wife use the same app. We each have an IMAP account for online mail. Also we each have a separate POP3 local folder for our older ‘saved’ emails. Thunderbird is just pointed towards one POP3 local folder at a time. So our accounts are: IMAP mail address A, IMAP mail address B, Pop3 account A or B. </p><p>If I want to look at my ‘saved’ emails I just swap Thunderbird account settings so it points towards my local POP3 folder. Normally Thunderbird local folders are directed to my wife’s POP3 folder. Windows explorer says her local folder contains 1,875 Files and 256 subfolders. It uses around 19 Gb of disk space, and the largest subfolder is almost 4GB (it’s a *.sbd folder). She likes to keep all her old emails!. </p><p>The problem is: </p><p>In recent years Thunderbird seems to automatically create copies of a subfolder that she created called ‘Gen’. (short for 'General'). See image. </p><p>These auto-created subfolders are called Gen1, Gen2, Gen 3 etc. They go up to Gen 6. </p><p>Some of the emails in these auto-created folders appear to have subject headings that she recognises, but they might  have no content or junk content. More often the mails appear to be exact duplicates of other mails, but they are probably not exact duplicates. The ‘remove duplicates’ add-on does not recognise them as duplicates, so we are left with many copies of mails that look exactly the same to us, but are subtly different. </p><p>We have tried to delete the unwanted additional emails from these ‘gen’ subfolders, but this generally doesn’t work. Sometimes it just appears to result in another ‘gen’ subfolder being created. It's a bit like 'Whack a mole'! </p><p>We have a suspicion that the ‘Compacting’ process may sometimes result in more ‘gen’ subfolders being created. </p><p>My wife has many other subfolders in her POP3 directory but they mostly work fine. It’s mainly the ‘Gen’ subfolder that creates problems, though 1-2 other subfolders hint at a similar issue. </p><p>When I switch the Thunderbird local folders to look at my POP3 folder I have no problems at all. My POP3 folder is much smaller than my wife’s. (3 Gbyte, 1,297 Files, 174 Folders) </p><p>We’re running Thunderbird 128.6.0esr (64-bit), but the problem occurred with previous versions of the programme (over a period of several years). We only have two add-ons. ‘Remove Duplicates’ and ‘import export tools NG'. </p><p>Can anyone suggest how we stop the auto-creation of these subfolders? Many thanks in anticipation! </p>",DuaneDoberman;MattAuSupport;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0;solver_id:7281661,1,0,0,,,

Context: Windows 11, TB 146.0.1. In TB, 5 mail accounts are configured, all IMAP, on 4 different providers.  </p><p>All accounts work perfectly except the first one, which is also the default account. This account and the second account are both on my father's Internet provider. The configurations of both accounts seem identical (I checked more than once), except obviously for the name and password. On the first account (which is unfortunately the one my father uses most), connexion is often refused, and TB then asks to retry or enter a new password. Retry and reentering the password fail to solve the issue. When the connection to the first account fails, the second account (for the same provider) always works. Some time later (usually at least several days later), the first account will work again, without any obvious reason.  </p><p>I tried exiting TB as well as clearing the cache, rebooting the computer, scanning for viruses, with no result. </p><p>I'd rather avoid re-creating the account in TB as this would change the order of the accounts, and my father (94 years old) might have difficulties to adapt to the change, but is someone can tell me how to recreate the account without changing the order, I am ready to try it. </p><p>I have a log of what happens when using only the ""bad"" account, and one for the good account from the same provider, but I don't know how to share them here. While creating the logs, I checked that if I set the second account as default (the first account having the issue before as well as after this), it still manages to connect. But of course, maybe the second account would have also had a connection issue later...  </p><p>Does someone have any explanation, or ideas about how to solve this issue? </p>",davito9w;MattAuSupport;siffemoz;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0,5,0,0,,,

Part of this is making sure that certain heavily used applications can be relied-upon in Linux. A couple days ago I successfully installed Thunderbird and moved my Profiles into the Linux version of Thunderbird. (This really needs better guidance from Mozilla! What I found on the subject was definitely NOT accurate!! Instructions should NOT be identical for all platforms). In a cautious abundance of excess, I repeated the same transfer onto a second Linux machine. Now I have Thunderbird running on my desktop Mac Mini AND on two separate Linux machines. Eventually, it will be removed from the Mac. What I never expected was that every time I received, deleted, read, etc., email, the same action would occur on the other two machines, regardless of on which machine I made changes. All accounts are set up as POP accounts, BTW.  How is this possible? are the three instances of Thunderbird aware of each other on my local network? Or, is there some sort of updating processing happening from my ISP? Regardless, I am thrilled that I can potentially use Thunderbird simultaneously on different machines, but... Down Side: Apparently, not everything is mirrored. I just moved a newly received email from the inbox to a local folder inside Thunderbird. That action was NOT copied on the other two machines. Is there anything I can do to keep ALL the folders in sync?  Thanks very much. </p>",davidkachel.photographer;mozilla98;MattAuSupport;,false,false,false,";useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",11,0,0,,,

I assumed I'd be able to copy the Data folder onto my new laptop, and point my new Tbird at it.  That's basically what I did the last time I got a new laptop.  No such luck, the new Tbird doesn't see the old config or message history.  Not sure why.  So I started using Gmail's mailer interface.  Bad mistake.  I HATE Gmail, specifically the Gmail web interface. </p><p>Ideally I would like to copy my Tbird history onto my new laptop, merge the old Tbird messages with the Gmail history from the last few months, and move onto Tbird for day-to-day use.

Perfect now I go to add another account and get a Different window/page from before, Ok cool enter email Oauth2 pops and I do that, then sends me to the password page asking for a password and ""Your login"" whatever that's suppose to be. entering a password does nothing but fail (makes sense since outlook only likes oauth2 at the moment) and I have no idea what to fill ""Your login"" with. the Continue button is greyed out and closing the login window shows it was never added. </p><p>now to make this worse this started with being unable to send an email. there is NO way that I can find to refresh the outgoing server auth token if it either expires or breaks (which does seem to happen even if it's not ""suppose to""), apart from removing and re adding the account but as stated above that is also broken you can't send emails from thunderbird unless you save the draft and send it from another device that works </p><p>more testing and the ""new"" login tool failed and worked at the same time it didn't ask for oauth the second time I tried but worked and could send... </p><p>like it's mainly two things that are broken, the newish login tool and the inability to refresh oauth tokens if it fails I'm running linux but this happens to people I know that use this In a work and personal capacity on windows as well. like do some basic login testing at least with outlook accounts like that might be the main issue but still they are one of the big players and this is unacceptable for a email client </p>",piman13;MattAuSupport;mozilla98;,false,false,false,;useragent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0;solver_id:7300245,4,0,1,,,
