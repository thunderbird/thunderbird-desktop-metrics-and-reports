* Number of Questions: 902
* Questions marked as solved: 204 ; 204/902 = 20%
* Ignored Questions (0 answers): 117/902 = 13%
* Questions answered to and not solved: 
    * By trusted contributor 488 ; 488/902 = 54%
    * Vs. random (i.e. non original poster and non trusted contributor) 10/902 = 1% (and there could be false positives here e.g. the person who last replied is the original poster using a second Mozilla Account or they are are they are hijacking the question thread)
    * Total `synthetic` solved rate = 54% + 20% = 74%
