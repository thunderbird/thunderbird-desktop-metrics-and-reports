* Number of Questions: 1023
* Questions marked as solved: 237 ; 237/1023 = 23%
* Ignored Questions (0 answers): 151 ; 151/1023 = 15%
* Questions answered to and not solved: 
    * By trusted contributor 525 ; 525/1023 = 51%
    * Vs. random (i.e. non original poster and non trusted contributor) 13/1023 = 1% (and it could be that the person who last replied is the original poster using a second Mozilla Account)
    * Total `synthetic` solved rate = 51% + 23% = 74%
